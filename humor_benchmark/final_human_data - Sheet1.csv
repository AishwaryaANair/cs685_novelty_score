situation_humor,"A man was driving home late one afternoon, and he was driving above the speed limit. He notices a police car with its red lights on in his rear view mirror.
He thinks “I can outrun this guy,” so he floors it and the race is on. The cars are racing down the highway — 60, 70, 80, 90 miles an hour. Finally, as his speedometer passes 100, the guy figures he can’t outrun the cop and gives up. He pulls over to the curb.
The police officer gets out of his cruiser and approaches the car. He leans down and says “Listen mister, I’ve had a really lousy day, and I just want to go home. Give me a good excuse and I’ll let you go.”
The man thought for a moment and said, “Three weeks ago, my wife ran off with a police officer.

situation_humor,"A man observed a woman in the grocery store with a three year old girl in her basket. As they passed the cookie section, the little girl asked for cookies and her mother told her no. The little girl immediately began to whine and fuss, and the mother said quietly, “Now Monica, we just have half of the aisles left to go through; don’t be upset. It won’t be long.”
Soon they came to the candy aisle, and the little girl began to shout for candy. And when told she couldn’t have any, began to cry. The mother said, “There, there, Monica, don’t cry–only two more aisles to go, and then we’ll be checking out.”
When they got to the check-out stand, the little girls immediately began to clamor for gum and burst into a terrible tantrum upon discovering there’d be no gum purchased. The mother patiently said, “Monica, we’ll be through this check out stand in 5 minutes and then you can go home and have a nice nap.”
The man followed them out to the parking lot and stopped the woman to compliment her. “I couldn’t help noticing how patient you were with little Monica,” he began. Whereupon the mother said, “I’m Monica . . . my little girl’s name is Tammy.”  Author Unknown",https://mirthandmotivation.com/2011/10/24/on-wisdom-humor-short-stories-to-make-you-think-smile/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error.

situation_humor,"So one time I was home alone and it was around dinnertime when I decided to make myself something to eat. I opened the freezer and dug around until I found what appeared to be chicken nuggets in an unopened plastic bag that for some reason, didn’t have any cooking instructions. Thinking that my parents must have thrown away the box for box tops, I called my mom to ask how long and at what temperature to cook chicken nuggets. She told me both of them, I laid out about 20 on a tray and stuck it in the oven, setting the timer before I walked out of the kitchen. When it was almost time to get my chicken nuggets, I walked into a cinnamon scented kitchen. I searched all over that kitchen, trying to find the cinnamon scent, leading me to the oven. I decide to turn on the oven light to see if maybe my mom had stuck some cookies in the oven and forgot to bake them, but instead, I find that the tray my chicken nuggets were on has cookies on it instead! As I’m trying to process what just happened, I hear the front door open and my mom shout delightedly, “Ooooo what’s that smell?” She walks into the kitchen and catches my confused expression. That’s when the spark ignited and she realized exactly what had happened. Somehow in some form, I had accidentally baked snickerdoodles. And that is why my parents can never take my cooking seriously.

There was a stack of blankets in the corner and a sleeping bag on the floor but only one bed. Being a gentleman, the priest said, “Sister, you sleep on the bed. I’ll sleep on the floor in the sleeping bag.”
Just as he got zipped up in the bag and was beginning to fall asleep, the nun said, “Father, I’m cold.” He unzipped the sleeping bag, got up, got a blanket and put it on her.
Once again, he got into the sleeping bag, zipped it up and started to drift off to sleep when the nun once again said, “Father, I’m still very cold.” He unzipped the bag, got up again, put another blanket on her and got into his sleeping bag once again.
Just as his eyes closed, she said, “Father, I’m sooooo cold.” This time, he remained there and said, “Sister, I have an idea. We’re out here in the wilderness where no one will ever know what happened. Let’s pretend we’re married.” The nun purred, “That’s fine by me.”
To which the priest yelled back, “Get up and get your own stupid blanket!”

What’s the matter dear?, she whispers as she steps into the room. Why are you sitting down here this time of the night? The husband looks up from his coffee, Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 16? he asks solemnly. Yes, I do she replies.
The husband paused, the words were not coming easily. Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car making love?. Yes I remember, said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.
The husband continued. Do you remember when he shoved the double barrel shotgun in my face and said, “Either you marry my daughter, or I’ll send you to jail for 20 years.” Yes I remember that too. She whispered softly.
He wiped another tear from his cheek and said,

The driver acknowledges the lady, turns to her and uses both hands in the same type of gesture and waves all his fingers at her.
The woman holds her right arm out at the driver and chops at it a few times with her left hand.
Then the driver puts his left hand on his right bicep and jerks his right arm up in a fist at her.
The woman then cups both of her hands under her breasts and lifts gently. So the driver places both of his hands at his crotch and gently lifts up.
Then the woman frowns, runs a finger up between her derriere, and gets off the bus.
There is another woman sitting in the front row of the bus who witnessed the whole exchange.
She speaks up, “That was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen on a public bus! What the

Anyway, we were able to go and pull anything we wanted to eat off the shelves. K decides she wants some macaroni and cheese to eat, so she pulls it off the shelf and starts making it. Meanwhile, I'm still looking around for something good to eat. I come back from roaming the shelves to see smoke pouring out of the microwave, while K is on the other side of the wall it's against, stirring the pot of boiling pasta on the stove. I scream and run to the microwave and open the door, to find a pile of money on fire in the microwave. K had been using the (so she thought) empty microwave to time the pasta cooking on the stove. She didn't know that you're not supposed to run a microwave when it's empty, and she never looked in the microwave before she turned it on (since she thought it was empty!)

It turned out that because her mother was away for the evening, they weren't able to put the money in the safe when the store closed so she had told them to hide the money in the microwave. K managed to burn up the entire day's takings which amounted to several thousand dollars.

Redditting on my phone and about to add said sauce to my salad, I didn't bother to look up before habitually giving the bottle a good shake. I'm not sure when or how the cap on the bottle broke but as soon as I gave the first upward shake, the cap flew off, followed by a steady stream of red all over my right shoulder. Upset, I grabbed napkins and was about to clean myself off. Within seconds, the shrill screams tore through the grocery store alerting me and everyone else to the horror unfolding.

This poor baby, who, only seconds ago, was fast asleep, had been awakened by an unnaturally spicy sauce around his eyes, nose and mouth. He had already started to rub them in an attempt to relieve the pain, exacerbating the burning. His mom grabbed napkins and ran to the sink to soak them. In desperation, I took my cold coconut water (with chunks) and proceeded to pour it on the child's face.

15 minutes later, the ambulance showed up. A store employee had called paramedics. They took the kid and mother to the ambulance to properly care for him and probably take him to a hospital. At this moment of relative calm, I realize the crowd who had gathered to help had sharply focused their attention on me. It felt like the end of The Birds. I stepped carefully (with my salad and hot sauce in hand) through an eerily quiet crowd, hoping to not evoke a brutal attack. As I walked past the ambulance, I offered my card to the mother, asked her to please send me the medical bill and repeated my profuse apologies. They were not well received.

TL;DR: Cap broke on insanely hot sauce and accidentally sprayed a stranger's baby in the face with it.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and the comforting remarks. Still no word from the mother. I don't know if that is a good thing or she's formulating a plan of attack. And yes, I definitely should have put my finger on the cap before shaking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/

One day, seven wrestlers come in yelling about new wrestling uniforms, and how excited they were. When they go over and pull out the uniforms, the whole class is kind of side eyeing them. Even without what I mention next, the suits look funny. I mean, it’s tight royal blue Spandex with a suspender style top. Absolutely funny already. But the wrestlers grab the uniforms and rush out of the room to go change in the bathroom, and come back to show them off.

Later that day, I was walking with my mom, when I tripped and hit my leg on the ground really hard. I yelled out “OW, MY SHIN” although my mom heard “OW, MY SHIT.” She started yelling about how that was a bad word and we didn’t say that word, and she was going to wash my mouth out with soap. I was a crying, bawling mess of a child, to the point I was doing that weird cry, stutter, hiccup noise. She paused in berating me and said “Who taught you that word?!” Of course, I told the truth and said “M-m-my teacher t-t-t-taught me that word!” and she started ranting about how she was going to call the school and get that teacher yelled at.


I tried to explain, “T-te-teacher said that shin meant leg I’m SO SORRY ILL N-N-NE-ne-never say it again.” My mom got quiet and realized her mistake. “…What did you say?”

Of course I started crying harder and I said “NO it’s just a test you’re going to wash my mouth out with soap again.”


When I finally calmed down enough to say it again, my mom apologized and to this day I always say “shin” loudly just to see her face blush.

situation_humor,"Ok, I have to say first that this actually happened about 3 weeks ago, but in my defense I just discovered this subreddit existed today.

A few months ago I received an old Japanese Arisaka rifle from my grandfather after he passed. I have spent the last few months researching the gun to figure out it's type and year of production when I came across a factoid that said that the gun weighs 9 lbs. I always thought the gun was heavy, but I never would have guessed almost 10 lbs. heavy.

I decided I would compare its weight with some of mine and my dad's old hunting guns because I really didn't have anything better to do for a few hours. I went into my dad's room, opened the gun cabinet, and started going through the guns one by one, shouldering them for a few seconds, and then putting them back. After about 5 rifles, I got to the shotguns. I picked up my dad's 20-gauge shotgun, shouldered it, and-

BAM!

After a few seconds of shock at what just happened, I saw pictures and papers flying around the trajectory of the shot. After I realized that the gun had just fired, I quickly started going over the weapon to figure out what had just happened. Turns out the gun had 3 shells of bird shot in it and the safety was off. When I was shouldering the gun, my finger must have moved out of instinct and squeezed the trigger, but the whole moment is a blur to me, even now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/

situation_humor,"So in 8th grade I used to read during class a lot. At the time I was reading an Artemis Fowl book, and for some reason I had two copies of the same book. So one day in my English class we were reading this other book (which I had already finished reading three days earlier), I was reading my own book and when it was finally my turn to read, I had no idea where we were. So the teacher took my book away, I found my spot, read the part and passed it to the next person to start reading.

So after I read my part, I took out my second copy of Artemis and picked up right where I left off. Skip a few minutes ahead, gets back to my turn to read, and again I don’t know where we are. So teacher takes a look at me, sees the book in my hands, then back to her desk obviously confused for a second. But shrugs it off knowing it’s me she’s dealing with (I’ve caused similar problems like this before), takes my second book and puts it on her desk, and makes me read my part.

Now my friend that sat two chairs down from me was also reading Artemis at the same time as me and with a quick look to him he knew exactly what I was planning. He took it out and passed it over without hesitation. I opened to a random spot and just pretended like I was reading. (At this point it was just to mess with my teacher.)

So skip forward again and my teacher sees me with the book again and says, “How many of those do you have?” I gave my smartass remark as “enough.” She took away that book, too. But now at this point I was out of books, and the rest of my class knew it. But the teacher didn’t know I was out. So she continued with her lesson and another friend of mine took two of her books and switched out two of the Artemis books on her desk to make them look like they were still there.


He passed the books slowly around the room, one at a time, until they were back to me. Then I took one out, opened to a random spot and just kept it open, waiting to get caught. I silently signaled to a few people in class and they started laughing. The teacher looked at what they were laughing at and saw me with yet another book. She looked at her desk where there were seemingly 3 Artemis books and saw me with a 4th. She took it, walked back to her desk, put it down, turned around, and saw me with the second book that got taken back on my desk!!!

The teacher thought she was going to win this game but underestimated my teamwork with my classmates. So the second she came over to me to take the seemingly 5th book, another classmate took back the other two books from her desk and split them up—sending one to me one way, and the other another way.


The teacher was very flustered and laughing hysterically at this point and there was no more teaching going on. The entire class was also going ballistic trying to see who would win. It was just a game of “How many books does this one 8th grader have?”

So at the end of the class she thought she had taken 11 books from me. I took pity on her and told her what was really happening. I told her that I had already read the first book, and all the teamwork that went on. We were both laughing and making jokes. In the end she agreed to let me read my own books as long as I kept track of the actual book we were reading. (Meaning, I ask the person next to me tell me when it’s my turn and they point out my spot to read so I don’t actually have to keep track.)",https://thoughtcatalog.com/january-nelson/2018/06/funny-stories/

“I saw this jelly fish in the aquarium and I thought it was really cool because it didn’t have any -testacles-.” and then like the classroom just emerged with so much laughter and I had no clue what was going on so I pleaded my friend to explain what was so funny I mean even THE TEACHER WAS LAUGHING AND I WAS GOING WTF.

There are frequently sounds that really take away from the experience, whether they be coughs, sneezes, whispers, dropped programs, etc. It is extremely frustrating and a properly timed disturbance can ruin the culmination of a piece since even quiet sounds carry so well throughout the hall.

So, after intermission when I had my 3rd drink of the evening, I was sitting in a tier about 25 feet above the stage during a symphony so that I could only see half the stage and about half the lower level seating. During the music, I thought I was going insane because I swore I could hear someone down below talking at a normal volume. I was terribly agitated and kept looking around, but couldn't see the person. What happened next is extremely rare.

The conductor actually stopped the music right in the middle of the performance and turned around to face the audience. I could hardly believe it.

I leaned forward to get a better view and there he was! A man, though now in a somewhat hushed manner, blatantly talking on his cell phone! I instantly went into a rage, leaned over the rail, and yelled in the large, acoustically-tuned, otherwise silent hall of ~2,300 people, ""GET OFF THE PHONE!!!""

I heard over a thousand people shift in their seats to look at me from all directions. I sat there shaking my head and looking at the people to my left and right in disbelief due to this exceptionally rude man, who had brought the concert to a grinding halt. I sure put that fucker in his place though.

Just then, the conductor picked up a microphone and stated that a woman in the audience had gone unconscious and may have had a heart attack or stroke and that a man was on the phone with 911 getting an ambulance to come. Though intoxicated, I was overcome with extreme embarrassment and slumped down in my seat so far, I almost slid out of it.
