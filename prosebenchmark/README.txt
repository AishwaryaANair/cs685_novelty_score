The proposed benchmark consists of the dataset and the NLP_Prose.ipynb which includes all the experiments and analysis that was carried out on this prose data.

The Dataset file contains 80 human-authored texts and 240 LLM-generated texts.
Of these 240 LLM-generated texts, there were 80 that were generated by prompting ChatGPT-4o, 80 generated by DeepSeek and the other 80 generated by Gemini.

The NLP_Prose.ipynb can be run in Colab to reproduce the results that were reported.
