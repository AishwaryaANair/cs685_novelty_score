# Prose Creativity Evaluation with LLMs

This repository contains code and datasets for evaluating the **creativity of prose** generated by LLMs using a custom scoring formula based on **originality**, **novelty**, and **diversity**. Models evaluated include **ChatGPT-4o**, **DeepSeek**, and **Gemini**.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **80 human-authored texts** across four tasks:
  1. Story Writing
  2. Script Writing
  3. Genre-Blended Essay Writing
  4. Alternate Endings
- **240 LLM-generated outputs** (3 per human text)

### Sources:
- **Project Gutenberg** – for public domain story/essay data
- **HITRECORD** – for alternate endings and collaborative fiction
- **High school worksheets** – for structured scripts

---

## Implementation Overview

### Preprocessing
- Removed punctuation and stopwords
- Tokenized and cleaned texts for semantic comparison

### Embedding Generation
- Used `e5-large-v2` model from `sentence-transformers` to generate embeddings for all texts

### Scoring Metrics
- **Originality:** Cosine similarity with human texts
- **Novelty:** Mean TF-IDF score
- **Diversity:** Type-Token Ratio (TTR)

### Creativity Score Formula
A weighted combination:
- `Originality (1 - cosine similarity)`
- `Novelty (TF-IDF)`
- `Diversity (TTR)`

Weights:
- α = 0.5 (originality)
- β = 0.3 (novelty)
- γ = 0.2 (diversity)

## GPT-4o as Judge

- Each LLM-generated text was rated by **GPT-4o** on a **1–10 originality scale**
- These scores were used to validate the custom creativity scores

---

## Graph-Based Representation

- A **bipartite graph** was built connecting each LLM text to similar human texts
- Edges drawn if cosine similarity > 0.9
- Node color used to reflect final creativity score

---

## Key Libraries Used

- `sentence-transformers`: Embedding generation
- `scikit-learn`: TF-IDF, cosine similarity
- `networkx`: Bipartite graph construction
- `matplotlib`: Visualization

---

## Results Summary

- **DeepSeek** showed the strongest correlation between GPT-4o originality scores and calculated creativity scores
- **ChatGPT-4o** and **Gemini** showed stylistic similarities to human texts, which occasionally reduced their creativity score
- The custom metric provided interpretability and alignment with human-style judgment

##  How to Run

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn networkx matplotlib
