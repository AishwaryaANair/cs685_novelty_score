The Arrow and the Song,Communication,"An arrow flew through open sky,
A message sharp, it aimed to try.
Yet softer still, a song took flight,
To reach the heart, not just the sight.

The arrow struck with force and will,
The song it danced, and lingers still.
One pierced the air with silent grace,
The other warmed a lonely place."
Crossing the Bar,Farewell,"The tide draws out, a hush remains,
Beyond the bar, no worldly chains.
A twilight path where silence guides,
To seas where no dark fear abides.

No cries, no storms disturb the stream,
Just moonlit peace, a sailor's dream.
The harbor fades, the soul drifts free,
Into the arms of mystery."
Design,Symbolism,"A spider weaves in quiet dread,
Above a moth, already dead.
The flower white, so pure, so still,
A symbol bent to nature’s will.

Each thread and wing and petal fair,
Conceals intent with thoughtful care.
The smallest signs in nature’s scheme,
Reflect a world not what it seems."
The Peace of Wild Things,Solace,"When night grows deep with heavy thought,
And all my hopes are overwrought,
I go where wild things cease to fear,
And silence hums both far and near.

A deer that grazes, calm and slow,
A stream that sings with steady flow.
Among the trees, I breathe and stand,
And peace returns with nature’s hand."
My Heart Leaps Up,Joy,"My heart leaps up when skies are gold,
When morning light breaks fresh and bold.
A rainbow arches far and wide,
A child's delight I cannot hide.

The joy of life in simplest form,
A sudden breeze, a summer storm.
For every dawn and dusk I see,
Awakes the youth still strong in me."
Because I Could Not Stop for Death,Mortality,"He came not loud, but kind and slow,
A carriage ride where shadows grow.
No haste, no fear, no chilling breath,
Just silence walked the path with Death.

We passed the school, the grain, the sun,
Each moment still, no need to run.
And in that hush, I came to see,
Immortality rode next to me."
The Red Wheelbarrow,Imagism,"So much depends on moments still—
A wheelbarrow by windowsill.
Red paint gleams wet in morning rain,
Where silence rests in calm domain.

Beside white chickens pecking slow,
A humble truth begins to show.
In smallest things, the world can lie,
Beneath a quiet, watching sky."
Ozymandias,Impermanence,"A shattered face in desert bare,
Proclaims a king who’s no longer there.
‘Look on my works,’ the granite cried,
Yet all around, the winds replied.

No throne remains, no court, no blade,
Just drifting dunes where power decayed.
The might of men, though fierce and wide,
Falls silent where the ages bide."
Mending Wall,Boundaries,"Stone by stone, the line is made,
A wall rebuilt though none invade.
Each spring we meet, yet still we part,
Divided by tradition’s heart.

Good fences make good neighbors still,
Yet wonder walks against that will.
What are we mending? What did fall?
Perhaps the wall. Perhaps it’s all."
To Autumn,Seasons,"O autumn, rich in golden light,
You steal the fields in crisp delight.
With ripened fruit and amber skies,
You bid the summer's breath goodbyes.

The bees grow slow, the winds begin,
A hush prepares the frost within.
Yet in your quiet, life still sings,
A warmth before the slumber clings."
Those Winter Sundays,Parenthood,"His hands were cracked from winter's sting,
Yet still he rose, did everything.
The fires lit with morning blue,
A silent love in chores he’d do.

No thanks was said, no warmth returned,
Yet in that chill, his presence burned.
Now older, I can plainly see,
Love sometimes hides in duty’s plea."
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,Alienation,"Do I dare disturb the air?
Where thoughts like whispers fill the stair.
I measure life in coffee spoons,
And drown beneath indifferent moons.

The streets wind tight in twilight’s haze,
Where dreams decay in silent maze.
A voice within that dares not shout—
So much to say, forever doubt."
The Lake Isle of Innisfree,Solitude,"I will arise and go once more,
To where the bee hums by the shore.
A cabin small, by stillness graced,
Where dreams and peace are interlaced.

Nine bean-rows near the quiet stream,
And starlight sings within a dream.
The city's cry may touch my ear,
But Innisfree is always near."
Kubla Khan,Imagination,"In Xanadu, a vision stirred,
Where caverns deep through magic purred.
A stately dome by rivers ran,
Decreed and dreamed by Kubla Khan.

A pleasure-dome in sun and shade,
Where fantasies and fears cascade.
A fragment held in poet’s breath,
Of worlds unborn and life past death."
Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,Defiance,"Do not go soft where shadows creep,
Let fire burn while others sleep.
Though dying light may dim and fade,
Rage 'gainst the close, be unafraid.

The wise, the wild, the grave, the kind,
All feel the pull of time behind.
Yet in that dusk, make bold your fight,
And do not go without your light."
I Heard a Fly Buzz—When I Died,Death,"The hush was thick, the stillness deep,
As mourners paused where silence weeps.
A fly broke through that sacred air,
A buzz that mocked the moment there.

The light had passed, the breath was gone,
Yet one small sound kept droning on.
A symbol strange, of life’s divide—
I heard a fly buzz—then I died."
Ode to a Nightingale,Transcendence,"O nightingale, your song soars high,
Above the pain where mortals lie.
You sing of truths the soul has sought,
Beyond the reach of weary thought.

No aging hand, no fading dream,
Can cage your tune or dim your gleam.
Your voice, eternal, pure and wide,
Lifts hearts where shadow cannot bide."
Nothing Gold Can Stay,Ephemerality,"The morning's gold, so soft, so bright,
Must yield its crown to fading light.
The leaf, the flower, the sunlit ray—
All beauty’s born to slip away.

In fleeting hue and dawn’s brief fire,
We glimpse the truth, we feel desire.
Yet in that loss, we understand,
The golden hour is never planned."
Musee des Beaux Arts,Indifference,"While Icarus fell through silent skies,
No one paused, no anguished cries.
The plowman worked, the sails still turned,
As myth became a fate unlearned.

In corners small, the great unfold,
While daily life moves firm and bold.
The world looks on but does not see—
A blink within eternity."
The Raven,Madness,"A shadow perched above my door,
It whispered 'Nevermore' and more.
With every beat, my heart grew cold,
Each echo darker, uncontrolled.

I begged for peace, a sign, a grace,
But only darkness took its place.
The raven’s cry, a mind unmade,
Still haunts me in the silence laid."
The Road Not Taken,Choice,"Two roads diverged in yellow wood,
And there I paused, as travelers should.
I took the one less marked and worn,
And from that step, new life was born.

Each path we choose, a tale to spin,
Of where we end, and where begin.
The quiet turn, the silent stake—
Shapes all the journeys we must take."
Chicago,Urban Life,"Hog butcher, stacker of the steel,
Your heartbeat forged on iron wheel.
You laugh with soot upon your face,
A city bold with brawling grace.

The wind may whip through alley tight,
Yet you burn fierce with factory light.
In all your scars, a living flame—
Chicago, proud, and never tame."
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,Temptation,"These woods are dark and full of sleep,
Where snow falls soft, and silence deep.
I pause to watch the flurries glide,
While duty waits on distant side.

The pull is strong to linger here,
But promises I made are near.
And miles I go before I rest,
With longing still within my chest."
The Waste Land,Disillusionment,"April wakes with cruel grace,
Where flowers bloom in barren place.
The fragments whisper in the dust,
Of dreams undone and shattered trust.

No comfort in the city’s breath,
Just voices echoing with death.
A world rebuilt in broken song—
The waste land drags our souls along."
Howl,Rebellion,"I saw the minds ablaze with flame,
Caged by systems, stripped of name.
They howled against the neon gods,
And marched alone on midnight sods.

Their visions torn by silent cries,
Yet still they reached for distant skies.
A shout for truth, raw, bold, and loud—
The rebel's voice beneath the shroud."
The Fish,Respect,"I caught a fish with scars like lines,
Each mark a tale, in scale designs.
It gazed with eyes so ancient, wide—
A soul that time itself can’t hide.

I let it go, that warrior bright,
Back to the deep, the fading light.
For some things born to fight and strive,
Deserve the chance to just survive."
Birches,Memory,"I dream of birches bent by snow,
And swinging up where spirits go.
A child again in nature's grip,
Escaping life's unsteady ship.

Though truth may say the ice has bowed,
I choose the path the dreams allowed.
To bend from earth and brush the skies—
Is how one learns to softly rise."
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (Revisited),Insecurity,"Shall I compare my thoughts to dust?
Each echo laced with aching trust.
In every glance, a doubt returns,
As time ticks on and passion burns.

Do I dare eat the peach alone?
Or sit in silence, cold as stone?
I wander past what might have been,
And lose myself in might-have-seen."
One Art,Loss,"The art of losing isn't hard,
Just misplace keys, a favorite card.
Then move to names and homes and years,
Till only silence calms the tears.

Practice enough, and you may find,
That loss reshapes the strongest mind.
But some things gone cut far too deep—
Like love, we never meant to keep."
The Negro Speaks of Rivers,Heritage,"I've known the rivers deep and wide,
Where history and soul abide.
From Congo's curve to Mississippi's song,
My roots have flowed and moved along.

Each wave recalls ancestral grace,
A voice that time cannot erase.
I've bathed in waters dark and free—
And felt the pulse of memory."
Still I Rise,Empowerment,"You may write me down with bitter pen,
But I will rise and rise again.
Like dust that dances in the breeze,
I shake off chains with graceful ease.

Through storms of hate and silent cries,
My spirit soars, it never dies.
I am the dream, the song, the flame—
And still I rise, through scorn and shame."
The Tyger,Mystery,"Tyger burning, fierce and bright,
In forest depths of fearful night—
What hand or eye designed your frame,
With stripes of flame and breath untame?

Did He who made the lamb so mild,
Also forge this burning wild?
A riddle beats in every roar—
What made the Tyger, and what for?"
This Is Just To Say,Guilt,"I ate the plums, cold and sweet,
That you had saved for morning treat.
Forgive me, though they were divine—
So crisp, so cool, their theft was mine.

A simple note, a quiet wrong,
That lingers soft and lingers long.
Desire took what care had laid—
A fleeting sin, in taste repaid."
Annabel Lee,Devotion,"It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea below,
That love lived loud in storm and swell—
For Annabel Lee, I loved so well.

The angels envied what we knew,
And took her from the ocean blue.
Yet even death can’t close that door—
My soul shall love her evermore."
To His Coy Mistress,Seduction,"Had we but time, my love, to spare,
We’d walk through years with tender care.
But time, he flies with fleeting pace,
And draws the bloom from beauty’s face.

So let us now, with passion's might,
Embrace the fire, defy the night.
For in love’s flame, let us combust—
Before our lips turn back to dust."
A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning,Separation,"Though we must part, let not tears fall,
Our love defies the distance tall.
Like compass arms that seem to roam,
Yet lean and draw the center home.

No tempest stirs our quiet sphere,
For what we hold is ever near.
A farewell soft, without despair—
Two souls as one, still breathe the air."
The Flea,Seduction,"See this flea, how small, how sly,
Yet in its leap, our bloods do lie.
Three lives in one—what bold decree—
My life, your life, and unity.

Deny me not what fate has made,
For in this tiny thief is laid
A bond so close, so strange, so true—
What nature dares, let us pursue."
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (Again),Existentialism,"I measure out my life in tea,
Afraid to speak, to shout, to be.
The mermaids sing, but not for me,
Adrift in lost identity.

The streets wind long with quiet dread,
Where nothing's said that must be said.
Each moment slips, a muffled call—
Do I exist at all, at all?"
Because I Could Not Stop for Death (Echo),Mortality,"He came so kind, I dared not flee,
With carriage waiting silently.
We passed the school, the field, the sun,
As if the journey just begun.

Yet centuries have softly flown,
And still I sit beside the stone.
The ride goes on, with quiet breath—
For even now, I dwell with Death."
Hope is the Thing with Feathers,Hope,"Hope is a bird with endless tune,
That sings through storm and silver moon.
It perches deep within the chest,
And gives the weary soul its rest.

It asks for naught, no crumb, no plea,
Yet stays through darkest misery.
And sweetest in the gale is heard—
That brave and feathered, steadfast word."
Ulysses,Perseverance,"Though aged hands may lose their might,
Still burns in me the old delight.
To strive, to seek, to not give in—
The fire of youth still burns within.

Beyond the known, I sail once more,
To chase the myths from distant shore.
For though we falter, fail, or bend—
We push ahead until the end."
The Garden,Retreat,"In shaded bower, green and still,
I shed the weight of human will.
No clamor here, no striving voice,
Just silence blooming by my choice.

Each petal sings without a sound,
And peace in every leaf is found.
Away from crowds, I lie unseen—
And dream within this hush of green."
Fern Hill,Innocence,"I ran through fields in golden gleam,
Where time stood still and joy was dream.
The apple boughs bent low and kind,
And youth was all I knew and mined.

But time, that thief, came soft and slow,
And turned the green to undertow.
Now lost in grown-up, shadowed chill,
I long to race through Fern Hill still."
The Wild Swans at Coole,Change,"The swans arise, white ghosts on lake,
While autumn winds the stillness break.
Once counted clear, now lost to time,
Their flight recalls a youth sublime.

Though beauty stays, I do not see
The self I was, or used to be.
They circle on, serene, untried—
While I grow old, and dreams subside."
Musee des Beaux Arts (Reprise),Apathy,"The world moves on as bodies fall,
The child still plays, the dogs still call.
A martyr bleeds beyond the frame—
While daily life forgets his name.

In painted scenes, indifference breathes,
As history rests beneath the sheaves.
And suffering, in golden hue—
Is passed unseen by me, by you."
The Second Coming,Apocalypse,"Turning and turning in widening gyre,
The falcon fails to hear the lyre.
Things fall apart, the center's gone,
And chaos rides where hope had shone.

The beast now slouches into birth,
A rough salvation scorched on earth.
The second coming draws too near—
With blood and shadow, wrath and fear."
Ode on a Grecian Urn,Art,"O silent shape, eternal tale,
Whose frozen dance shall never pale.
Though time may pass and lovers fade,
You keep them ever young, remade.

A truth you hold in painted breath—
That beauty conquers even death.
Though still, you speak, serene and wise:
“Truth is beauty”—your soft replies."
The Colossus,Grief,"I speak to stones that will not hear,
To giant ruins, sharp and sheer.
A voice once thundered from your face,
Now dust, now shadow, void of grace.

I piece your parts and beg reply,
From shattered lips that line the sky.
But silence reigns where grief has grown—
A monument I mourn alone."
We Real Cool,Recklessness,"We left school and played the game,
We danced in dusk, embraced the flame.
We sang too loud and drank too fast,
And wrote our futures in the past.

We real cool, with golden glare—
But midnight waits without a prayer.
The jazz is sweet, the shadows lean—
And we die soon, forever teen."
Daddy,Trauma,"You stood so tall, a shadow vast,
But I have left that mold at last.
No longer bound by heavy tread,
I walk beyond the things you said.

A boot, a bell, a ghost, a name—
Yet I am done with all that shame.
You do not live inside me now—
I’ve broken free, I’ve kept my vow."
A Blessing,Wonder,"The ponies step from dusk to field,
With grace the human heart can’t shield.
Their gentle touch, their silent grace,
Unfolds the soul in sacred space.

A moment blooms with quiet light,
Where joy is pure and spirits right.
We bow before this soft, sweet thing—
A blessing born of everything."
Digging,Heritage,"My father dug with steady hand,
Turned up the life beneath the land.
Now I, with pen not spade, still toil,
To lift our lineage from the soil.

The roots run deep, the craft endures,
Through every word the past assures.
With each line carved, with each word sown—
I dig in verse, and call it home."
One Boy Told Me,Parenthood,"He said the moon was made of bread,
And dreams were stitched into his bed.
His words, so odd, yet sharp and clear,
Made sense in ways that brought me near.

The world through him turns bright and round,
A playground stitched with sky and sound.
One boy told me, and I believe—
That wonder lives in what we weave."
Blackberry-Picking,Desire,"We plucked the dark and bursting fruit,
With purple hands and tongues to suit.
But sweetness fades, and berries rot—
Desire once had is soon forgot.

We chase, we hoard, we hope, we lose—
Yet still the bramble’s thorns we choose.
For even if the juice turns black—
We’d always go and gather back."
Morning Song,Motherhood,"Love set you down in silent room,
And broke the hush with morning bloom.
Your cry, a note of rawest grace,
Now echoes through this trembling space.

I wake to feed, to soothe, to hold—
A love both frightening and bold.
No lullaby could quite impart—
The weight and wonder in my heart."
The Applicant,Gender Roles,"First, are you ready? Can you sew?
Will you wear smiles where pain should go?
We'll patch you up and make you right,
A plastic bride in business light.

You’ll love, you’ll serve, you won’t grow old—
Just sign below in ink and gold.
The world sells roles we never chose—
And buries truth in wedding clothes."
The Day Lady Died,Grief,"I walked through aisles and sipped my tea,
But Billie’s voice still haunted me.
Her song had left the air that day,
And time itself had slipped away.

No monument, no final call—
Just jazz that echoed down the hall.
A world went still, a breath went thin—
When Lady’s song fell silent then."
Poetry,Art,"I, too, disliked it once, it’s true—
Until it spoke in voices new.
Not grand, not proud, just raw and clean—
A rhythm pulled from what we’ve seen.

In scraps of truth and sharpened tone,
It made the fractured feel like home.
And now I write, and now I see—
That poetry once rescued me."
The Woman at the Washington Zoo,Confinement,"Pressed behind the glass and gate,
She dreams of shedding structured fate.
The beasts within, the clothes she wears—
All bind her breath in silent stares.

Yet birds arise beyond the chain,
And call her name in summer rain.
She aches to run, to live, to be—
Unzipped from cold civility."
The Armadillo,Fragility,"Paper lanterns rise in flame,
And crash where wild things have no name.
The armadillo curls in fright,
A shell against the burning night.

We watch as sparks descend like tears,
And beauty bruises what it nears.
In celebration, something dies—
A fragile truth beneath the skies."
