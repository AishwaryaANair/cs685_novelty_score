# Poetry Creativity Evaluation (LLM vs Human)

This project evaluates the **creative quality of poetry** generated by large language models (LLMs) by comparing them with human-written poems using **semantic similarity graphs** and **GPT-4o originality scoring**.

The analysis includes:
- Sentence embedding comparisons using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Graph-based creativity scoring
- GPT-4o originality judgment (1â€“10 scale)
- Correlation plots and interpretability analyses

## Files & Descriptions

### ðŸ”¹ `LLM_Creativity_Graph_Poetry.ipynb`
- Builds a bipartite similarity graph between LLM and human poems.
- Computes the graph-based creativity score:

$$
\text{Creativity}_{1\text{--}10} = 1 + 9 \cdot (1 - \text{avg similarity})
$$


- Outputs:
  - `LLM_Poems_Creativity_Scored_topk.csv`
  - `LLM_Poems_Creativity_Scored_AvgSim_1to10.csv`
- Generates:
  - Barplot: Average originality vs creativity score per model
  - Scatterplot: GPT-4o vs graph-based score per poem
  - Correlation heatmap between the two scoring metrics

## Dataset Structure

All relevant datasets are located in the `dataset/` directory.

### Human Poems
- `60_Diverse_Human_Poems.csv`  
  Human-authored poems written before 2018, labeled by theme.

### LLM-Generated Poems
- `Poems_Collection_ChatGPT-4o.csv`
- `Poems_Collection_Gemini.csv`
- `Poems_Collection_LLAMA.csv`
- `Poems_Collection_Mistral_AI.csv`

Each file includes:
- Title
- Poem
- Source (LLM name)
- Thematic label
- GPT-4o originality score (1â€“10)

### Prompts Used
- `60_Prompts_for_LLM_Generation.csv`  
  Structured instructions for generating poems from LLMs, aligned with human themes.

- `All_Poems_Originality_Scored.csv`
All_Poems_Originality_Scored.csv contains the complete set of human-authored poems along with their thematic categories, identity, and originality scores (judged and got the scored from GPT-4o). It forms the core dataset for all creativity evaluations and comparisons.

## Output CSVs (in `Results/`)

### `LLM_Poems_Creativity_Scored_topk.csv`
- Creativity scores computed using **maximum similarity** to the top-3 human poems.

### `LLM_Poems_Creativity_Scored_AvgSim_1to10.csv`
- Final normalized creativity score (1â€“10 scale) using **average similarity** to the top-5 closest human-authored poems.
