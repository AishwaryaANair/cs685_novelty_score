As twilight paints the western sky.

The pilot waits, unseen, unknown,
To steer a soul to shores unshown.
The tide runs deep, a silent sweep,
To carry slumber, vast and steep.

No mournful bell, no anguished cry,
Just stillness where the day drifts by.
A gentle push, a whispered grace,
Beyond the known, to that calm place.

And though the bar I now must clear,
May peace attend, and banish fear.
For what awaits on that far strand,
Is home at last, in God's own hand.",9,Gemini,0.277
Design,Symbolism,"A spider spins, a silver thread,
Across the pane where light is shed.
No random dance, no aimless trail,
But geometric, fine detail.

Each silken spoke, a whispered clause,
Of hunger held, and nature's laws.
The sticky traps, a patient art,
Reflecting skies within its heart.

So too, the world, a woven thing,
Where patterns rise, and secrets cling.
The spiral shell, the feathered wing,
Each curve and line, a truth they bring.

For in the warp and weft we find,
A grander loom, a cosmic mind.
And every form, a coded sign,
Of purpose etched, a plan divine.",10,Gemini,0.368
The Peace of Wild Things,Solace,"When shadows lengthen, sharp and deep,
And human clamors cease to creep
Into the stillness of the wood,
Where ancient calm has always stood,

I turn to creatures, furred and fleet,
Whose silent wisdom, bittersweet,
Distills a balm upon my soul,
And makes the fractured spirit whole.

The grazing deer, with watchful eye,
Beneath the vast and starlit sky,
The owl's soft hoot, a gentle sound,
On mossy boughs, where peace is found.

They do not fret, they do not weep,
But trust the slumber, vast and deep,
Of earth that cradles every breath,
And conquers even silent death.

In this wild haven, dim and cool,
My troubled thoughts begin to pool
Like shadowed waters, still and clear,
Reflecting solace, banishing fear.",8,Gemini,0.369
My Heart Leaps Up,Joy,"A rainbow arches, sudden bright,
A painted promise in the light.
And in that curve of vibrant hue,
My tethered spirit leaps anew.

No grand fanfare, no trumpet's call,
Just color answering nature's thrall.
A simple grace, a fleeting gleam,
Awakens joy within a dream.

As when a child, with eyes so wide,
First sees the world in joyful stride,
So leaps my heart, a startled thing,
At beauty that the moments bring.

This sudden spark, this vibrant flight,
A wellspring pure, a keen delight.
For in such moments, brief and bold,
The heart's true story can unfold.",7,Gemini,0.419
Daddy,Confession,"You built your silence, brick by stone,
A fortress where I stood alone.
Your gaze, a weight, a heavy toll,
Upon a small and searching soul.

I chipped away with childish pleas,
At granite strength, unyielding ease.
Your love, a landscape stark and bare,
A whispered promise in the air.

The shadows stretched, a father's form,
A looming presence in the storm
That raged within my fragile breast,
A longing never quite at rest.

And now I speak across the years,
Through mists of half-remembered tears.
The iron effigy remains,
A landscape etched with unspoken pains.

This truth I lay upon the page,
A turning of a silent age.
The child still whispers in the gloom,
Confessing to an empty room.",6,Gemini,0.398
Fire-Caught,Artistic Spirit,"A brushstroke flares, a crimson bloom,
Consuming canvas in the room
Of inner vision, fiercely bright,
A phoenix born of darkest night.

The clay takes heat, a molten sigh,
Beneath the fingers reaching high.
A fragile form, both fierce and bold,
A story in the fire told.

The words ignite, a burning brand,
Across the page, a fiery strand.
Each syllable, a leaping spark,
Illuminating shadows dark.

This fire-caught soul, it cannot rest,
Until the vision, manifest,
Leaps forth in hues that sear and sing,
The fervent offering art must bring.

For in that crucible of heat,
Where passions clash and spirits meet,
The truest forms are forged anew,
An ember's muse, forever true.",9,Gemini,0.514
A Bronzeville Mother Loiters...,Justice,"The pavement sighs beneath her feet,
A rhythm echoing in the heat
Of Bronzeville's pulse, a weary beat.
Her gaze, a hawk's upon the street.

A phantom weight upon her hand,
A son's lost laughter in the land
Where shadows stretch and futures fade,
A silent debt that's never paid.

The scales of justice, tipped and blind,
Have left a wound within her mind.
No gilded dome, no solemn vow,
Can soothe the ache she carries now.

She loiters, not in idle guise,
But with the fury in her eyes
Of one who knows the bitter cost
When innocence is truly lost.

Each passing siren, sharp and keen,
Reopens wounds that still are green.
And in her stance, a quiet plea,
For balance, truth, and liberty.",10,Gemini,0.482
Theme for English B,Racial Identity,"The paper waits, a stark white page,
To catch the thoughts that now engage
A mind that holds a history's weight,
And sees the world through a different gate.

They ask for truth, a simple line,
But truth wears shades that intertwine.
The jazz-soaked nights, the gospel's plea,
Are woven deep inside of me.

This ink that flows, it knows my name,
My city's grit, my spirit's flame.
It carries echoes, soft and low,
Of journeys that they do not know.

So let the words spill, dark and bright,
A testament beneath the light.
For in this voice, distinct and clear,
A self emerges, standing here.

The ""B"" I write, it holds the key
To more than just identity.
It breathes a life, uniquely spun,
Beneath a shared and watchful sun.",6,Gemini,0.456
A Blessing,Peace,"Sun spills like honey on the grass,
Where gentle giants softly pass.
A ripple stirs the quiet air,
As velvet muzzles nuzzle there.

Their breath, a whisper on my hand,
A language I can understand
Without a word, a deep release,
A settling into perfect peace.

The frantic pulse within me slows,
As something ancient gently flows
From creature calm to spirit frayed,
A silent promise, softly laid.

No need for striving, no defense,
Just yielding to this sweet suspense.
The world recedes, its edges blur,
In the profound and tender stir

Of gentle eyes and patient grace,
A blessing in this quiet space.
And in that touch, so soft and deep,
A weary heart finds rest and sleep.",10,Gemini,0.42
To Be of Use,Work Ethic,"Not the bright bloom that flaunts its hour,
But roots that delve with silent power,
Through stubborn earth, unyielding stone,
To draw the life that makes them known.

The calloused hand, the steady gaze,
That shapes the world in countless ways.
The weight borne well, the task embraced,
A quiet dignity interlaced.

No fleeting praise, no trumpet's sound,
But purpose firm, on solid ground.
The lever's creak, the hammer's fall,
Responding to a deeper call.

To lend a strength, a willing hand,
To cultivate and understand.
To be a vessel, strong and true,
Through which the world can fashion anew.

This quiet striving, day by day,
Not for the glitter, or the play,
But for the deep and honest worth,
Of being rooted in the earth.",8,Gemini,0.46
Abou Ben Adhem,Compassion,"The angel wrote with pen of light,
A list of souls who loved the Right.
And Abou Ben Adhem, waking mild,
Inquired if his name graced the child
Of that bright scroll. The angel sighed,
""Nay, not among the sanctified.""

A gentle sorrow touched his face,
No hint of envy, no disgrace.
""Then write me,"" spoke that soul serene,
""As one who loves his fellow men.""

The angel vanished, and returned
With names where holy fervor burned.
And lo! Ben Adhem's name led all,
Whose love embraced both great and small.

For heavenly ledgers count it true,
That hearts which outward kindness knew,
Though lacking bright and fervent claim,
Burn with a more encompassing flame.
The love for humankind, so deep,
A place within God's grace will keep.",6,Gemini,0.2
London,Urban Decay,"A skin of soot on brick and stone,
Where yesterday's ambition's groan
Still echoes in the hollowed square,
A phantom weight upon the air.

The Thames, a serpent, dark and slow,
Reflects the grime that drifts below.
Each crumbling arch, a tooth decayed,
Where commerce once its power displayed.

The iron bones of industry,
Rust softly in the weeping sky.
A broken pane, a boarded door,
Whisper of lives that are no more.

The vibrant pulse has ebbed away,
Leaving the ghosts of yesterday
To wander streets in silent plight,
Beneath a dim and fading light.

And though new towers pierce the haze,
A shadow of the former days
Still clings to alleys, damp and deep,
Where urban sorrows softly sleep.",8,Gemini,0.443
Song of Myself (excerpt),Self,"I sing the body electric, free,
Each atom humming, wild in me.
A universe within this skin,
Where starlight dances, deep within.

I lean and loaf, invite my soul,
To wander where the currents roll
Through veins that map a boundless land,
Held in the hollow of my hand.

I am the whisper and the shout,
The budding leaf, the winter's rout.
I hold all ages in my gaze,
Through sunlit dawns and hazy days.

No single truth can bind my form,
I break the mold, outride the storm.
For in this self, forever new,
The cosmos breathes and pulses through.

I celebrate this vibrant core,
And what it was, and will be more.
An untamed echo, strong and clear,
A song of self, forever here.",7,Gemini,0.406
The Tropics in New York,Homesickness,"The city breathes a steel-grey sigh,
Beneath a cold and alien sky.
But in the market's humid hush,
A memory blooms, a vibrant rush.

The scent of mango, sweet and deep,
Awakens senses lulled to sleep
By concrete dust and taxi's blare,
A phantom breeze within the air.

Plantains gleam, a golden hoard,
Like sunshine that my soul adored.
The callaloo, a verdant dream,
Beside the pale and frozen stream
Of city life, so stark and wan,
Where tropic colors are withdrawn.

My tongue recalls the ocean's taste,
The salt-laced wind, in hurried waste.
Here, silence holds a different dread,
For voices of the sun are dead.

These emerald ghosts of heat and light,
Haunt pavements cold in endless night.
And in their spectral, fragrant grace,
I find the longing for that place.",7,Gemini,0.399
The Voice,Grief,"The voice is gone, a silence fills the air,
A hollow echo where its music rare
Once danced and soared, a vibrant, joyful sound,
Now only absence on the air is found.

Each room remembers where its laughter rang,
Each empty corner holds the songs it sang.
A phantom cadence lingers in the breeze,
A ghost of comfort rustling through the trees.

The world moves on, its melodies unfold,
But in my hearing, stories remain untold.
A muted chord, a harmony undone,
A constant ache beneath the setting sun.

And though I listen with a yearning deep,
That voice now slumbers in an endless sleep.
A precious sound, forever lost to me,
A silent burden for eternity.",6,Gemini,0.414
Hymn to Intellectual Beauty,Philosophy,"A shadow falls, we know not where,
A fleeting grace upon the air.
A sudden dawn within the soul,
That makes the fractured spirit whole.

It visits minds in silent flight,
A spark of truth, a guiding light.
In poet's dream and scholar's quest,
A hunger born within the breast.

We name it beauty, wisdom's gleam,
A phantom caught within a dream.
We chase its form in art and thought,
A solace dearly, deeply sought.

Though sense perceives it not, we feel
Its gentle power, strong and real.
A bond that ties the world as one,
Beneath the ever-turning sun.

Oh, unseen presence, pure and bright,
Sustain our search for inner light.
Lest custom dull and self deceive,
The truth by which our souls can live.",7,Gemini,0.316
Travel,Wanderlust,"The open road, a beckoning, bright line,
Invites the spirit where new vistas shine.
Each mile a promise, whispered on the breeze,
Of landscapes waiting beyond the familiar trees.

The engine hums a restless, eager tune,
Beneath the ever-changing sky and moon.
A journey outward, shedding every tie,
To seek adventure where new pathways lie.

No final haven sought, no place to stay,
But just the movement, come what may.
To breathe the air of distant, unknown lands,
Held gently in the traveler's open hands.

The soul expands with every turn and bend,
A sense of freedom that will never end.
For in this motion, swift and ever free,
The heart discovers what it longs to be.",6,Gemini,0.463
Some People,Modern Life,"The hurried steps on pavements hard and cold,
A million stories silently untold.
Each face a screen, reflecting hurried light,
Lost in the current of the day and night.

The digital hum, a constant, unseen thread,
Connecting souls, yet leaving spirits unfed.
We rush and scroll, in a collective daze,
Through fleeting moments in a modern maze.

The curated image, carefully displayed,
A fragile mask, a role that must be played.
We seek connection in a crowded space,
Yet often find a solitary, lonely place.

The city breathes a restless, anxious sigh,
Beneath the vast and indifferent sky.
And in this throng, each striving to be seen,
A quiet yearning for what might have been.",6,Gemini,0.51
The Chambered Nautilus,Transformation,"A pearly spiral, built with patient hand,
A testament to life's expanding strand.
Each chamber grown, a former dwelling left,
A constant striving, beautifully bereft
Of prior limits, reaching for the new,
A wider vista, bathed in ocean blue.

The fragile creature, guided by its need,
Unfurls its being, planting future seed.
No fear of change, no clinging to the past,
But forward motion, meant to ever last.

So too the soul, in its evolving quest,
Sheds outworn selves, to find a truer rest.
Expanding wisdom, circle after ring,
The silent anthem that all changes sing.",7,Gemini,0.341
"Tears, Idle Tears",Sorrow,"Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
A silent weeping for what might have been.
A memory stirred, a phantom of the past,
A sweetness lost, too beautiful to last.

The autumn fields, the sinking of the sun,
Awaken sorrow for what life has done.
A gentle melancholy, soft and deep,
A longing that the heart can only keep.

The days gone by, like shadows they appear,
A tender sadness, mingled with a tear.
A sense of loss, though joy once had its sway,
A haunting beauty at the close of day.

These idle tears, a language of the soul,
Expressing grief beyond our clear control.
A quiet weeping for a vanished grace,
A lingering sorrow time cannot erase.",10,Gemini,0.206
The Second Coming,Apocalypse,"The widening gyre, a spiraling descent,
Where order breaks, and ancient purpose rent.
The falcon's cry no longer finds its mark,
As chaos reigns within the fading dark.

The center fails, the ties that once held fast
Dissolve in shadows of a dying past.
A sense of dread, a stirring in the deep,
As slumbering terrors from their silence leap.

The beast awakes, its primal hunger keen,
A monstrous form in visions yet unseen.
The innocent are lost, the righteous fall,
As anarchy engulfs and swallows all.

No gentle dawn, no promise of rebirth,
But final darkness descends upon the earth.
A broken world, where only fragments lie,
Beneath the gaze of a cold, indifferent sky.",6,Gemini,0.33
What lips my lips have kissed...,Loss,"What lips my lips have kissed, and where, and when,
Remain a phantom touch, beyond all ken.
A fading echo of a whispered name,
A ghost of passion, like a dying flame.

The memories stir, like leaves in autumn's breath,
A bittersweet reminder of lost death
And vanished joy, a beauty that has flown,
Leaving the heart a solitary stone.

The warmth is gone, the vibrant hues now fade,
A tapestry of moments gently laid
To rest within the chambers of the mind,
A treasure lost, that time cannot unbind.

And though new lips may seek a tender art,
The imprint lingers on a wounded heart.
A silent yearning for what used to be,
A haunting echo of eternity.",10,Gemini,0.238
One Need Not Be a Chamber,Fear,"One need not be a chamber to be haunted,
A single shadow, relentlessly flaunted
Across the mind's interior landscape bare,
Can breed a terror that no walls can snare.

The silent footfall, just beyond the door,
The whispered name unheard, and nothing more,
Can build a prison stronger than all steel,
Where icy tendrils of dark feeling steal.

The breath grows shallow, vision starts to blur,
As phantom shapes and nameless horrors stir.
The safest room becomes a place of dread,
Where fear's cold tendrils wrap around the head.

No lock can hold, no fortress can withstand,
The inner demons of a trembling hand.
For terror's grip, a chilling, stark embrace,
Finds its true dwelling in the mind's own space.",10,Gemini,0.398
Root Cellar,Survival,"The earth breathes cool beneath the heavy ground,
Where life lies dormant, silently profound.
A hushed domain of shadowed, earthy scent,
Where winter's harshness finds a slow relent.

The sturdy bins hold treasures, dark and deep,
Potatoes dreaming in their earthy sleep.
Onions with papery skins, a pungent store,
A promise whispered from the season's core.

A simple bounty, gathered with great care,
A sustenance against the winter's snare.
A testament to nature's steady hand,
A lifeline buried in this quiet land.

This humble space, a sanctuary true,
Where life endures, and sees the winter through.
A rooted strength, a primal will to keep,
The fragile flame of living from its sleep.",7,Gemini,0.424
The Snow Man,Perception,"One must have a mind of winter to behold
The frosted branches, stark and crystal-cold.
To see the landscape stripped of vibrant hue,
A world transformed, entirely fresh and new.

The junipers, weighed down with silent white,
The distant hills, a monochrome in sight.
No warmth of sun, no echo of a breeze,
Just frozen stillness among the barren trees.

The snowman stands, a figure stark and bare,
Reflecting back the winter's icy stare.
A silent witness to the altered scene,
A world perceived, both beautiful and keen.

To truly see this stark and silent art,
Requires a chilling stillness in the heart.
To shed the warmth, embrace the frozen view,
And find a beauty that the north winds brew.",8,Gemini,0.266
A Noiseless Patient Spider,Loneliness,"A noiseless patient spider, on a promontory vast,
Unfurling filaments, persistently cast.
Exploring vacancy, a thread so fine and frail,
Reaching for connection on the empty gale.

No anchor firm, no sure and steady hold,
Just tireless seeking, brave and ever bold.
Projecting from its solitary sphere,
A yearning outward, banishing all cheer.

So too the soul, in silent isolation's keep,
Extends its tendrils through the slumbering deep.
A ceaseless striving, for a touch unknown,
A bridge across the chasm, all alone.

This patient spinning, in the void's expanse,
A mirror to the heart's unyielding trance.
Reaching, connecting, in a world so wide,
A lonely thread on life's relentless tide.",7,Gemini,0.208
Pied Beauty,Religious Awe,"Glory be to God for dappled things—
For skies of couple-colour as a brindled cow;
For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;
Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;

Landscapes plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;
And all trades, their gear and tackle and trim.
All things counter, original, spare, strange;
Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)   

With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;
He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change, praise him.",10,Gemini,0.037
The House on the Hill,Despair,"The house stands brooding, on the lonely height,
A silhouette against the fading light.
Each darkened window, like a vacant stare,
Reflecting back a silent, deep despair.

The wind that whispers through the broken eaves,
Carries the sorrow that the structure weaves.
A heavy stillness settles in the air,
A monument to burdens hard to bear.

No laughter echoes in the empty hall,
Just shadows lengthening on the crumbling wall.
A sense of loss, a spirit overthrown,
A silent testament to grief alone.

And those who dwell within its somber keep,
Find solace only in a dreamless sleep.
A refuge sought from joy's bright, piercing ray,
In the perpetual twilight of dismay.",10,Gemini,0.416
Poetry,Metapoetry,"A silent canvas, waiting for the hue,
A whispered rhythm, longing to break through.
The poet's heart, a crucible of fire,
Forging emotions into forms that inspire.

Each word a brushstroke, carefully applied,
To paint the landscapes dwelling deep inside.
A tapestry of sound and sense entwined,
A universe within a phrase defined.

The sculpted verse, a monument to thought,
A fragile beauty, earnestly besought.
To capture moments, fleeting and profound,
In melodies where timeless truths are found.

This act of crafting, born of inner need,
A silent language that the soul can read.
To build with language, vibrant and alive,
And make the abstract tangible and thrive.",7,Gemini,0.442
The Windhover,Spirituality,"I caught this morning morning's minion, kingdom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding
High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing
In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,
As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding
Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding

Stirred for a bird,—the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!
Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here
Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion
Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!   

No wonder of it: shéer plód makes plough down sillion
Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,
Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion.",10,Gemini,0.014
We Wear the Mask,Deception,"We wear the mask that grins and lies,
It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—
This debt we pay to human guile;
With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,
And mouth with myriad subtleties.

Why should the world be over-wise?
Why should they see us where we sigh?
Nay, let them only see us, while
We wear the mask.

We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries
To thee from tortured souls arise.
We sing, but oh the clay is vile
Beneath our feet, and long the mile;
But let the world dream otherwise,
We wear the mask!",6,Gemini,0.025
The Listeners,Mystery,"'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
Of the forest's ferny floor.

And no one descended to the Traveller;
No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
Where he stood perplexed and still.

But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:

Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveller's call.

And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
Their stillness answering his cry,
While the horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
'Neath the starred and leafy sky;

For he suddenly smote on the door even
Louder, and lifted his head:—
'Tell them I came, and no one answered,
That I kept my word,' he said.

Never the least stir made the listeners,
Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness
Of the still house thereawake.

The Traveller hastened from the door away
And into the silence he strode;
Never again looked back at the deserted house
As he went down the lonely road.",9,Gemini,0.056
When I Was One-and-Twenty,Youth,"When I was one-and-twenty
I heard a wise man say,
‘Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free.’

But I was one-and-twenty,
No use to talk to me.

When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,
‘The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;
’Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue.’

And I am two-and-twenty,
And oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.",9,Gemini,0.017
The Garden of Proserpine,Paganism,"Here, where the world is quiet;
Here, where all trouble seems
Dead out of sight and riot
Blown down the ways like dreams;
Land where the sun lies hidden,
And time lies broken and bare;
Flowers whose names are forbidden;
Fruits that turn dust in the air;

For whom are these dim fields spread
Like cloths of sombre hue;
For whom are these strange fruits fed,
Where sleep that knows not dew
Nor wind that sings in sleeping
Death's praises overhead
No fruit here swells for keeping,
No leaf here falls for bed;

But here in twilight's hush
He feels the breath of things;
Here in the heart's dim rush
Feels the wind's chafing wings;
Feels the cold coils of sleep
Round wearied heart and head;
Feels, though the grass be deep,
His feet among the dead;

For whom are these wild weeds sown,
Here in the silent light;
For whom is the darkness shown
Where day dissolves in night;
For whom in twilight stands
The shade of Love, a wing
Burned through with barren brands?
Sad, sad things are here.",8,Gemini,0.299
The Unmarked Plot,Class,"He came to work the land, with calloused hand,
A season's need upon a master's strand.
No kin to claim him when his strength gave way,
Just weary bones at the close of a long day.

He slept in shadows, ate at the far board,
A silent presence, seldom seen, ignored
Beyond the labor that his muscles lent,
A life unvalued, quickly spent.

And when the final stillness held him fast,
No grand farewell, no memories to last
In hearth or hall. Just earth turned over deep,
Where nameless workers find their final sleep.

The ledger closed, another season done,
The hired man vanished with the setting sun.
A life's brief chapter, easily erased,
A silent story in a forgotten space.",8,Gemini,0.569
The Anchoring Thread,Motherhood,"A whispered comfort in the darkest night,
A steady beacon, burning ever bright.
A hand that guides through childhood's tangled maze,
A love that deepens through all life's strange ways.

A wellspring of compassion, freely given,
A silent language that ascends to heaven.
A strength that shelters, fierce against the storm,
A constant presence, keeping spirits warm.

Through changing years, that bond will still endure,
A tapestry of feelings, pure and sure.
A sacrifice unseen, a tender art,
An anchoring thread that binds a beating heart.

That endless giving, selfless and profound,
Where love's true measure can always be found.
A mother's spirit, a protective grace,
Leaving its imprint on time and space.",6,Gemini,0.402
The World Is Too Much With Us,Materialism,"The world, a clamor of acquiring greed,
A restless hunger that will never feed.
We chase the fleeting phantom of display,
And lose the beauty of the passing day.

Our senses dulled by constant, bright demand,
We barter spirit for a grasping hand.
The natural world, a whisper faint and low,
Lost in the din of what we think we know.

The sea that bares her bosom to the moon,
The winds that howl a melancholy tune,
Are sights unseen, their ancient magic lost,
In this relentless, avaricious cost.

Our hearts grow cold, our inner vision fades,
Consumed by trinkets and their empty parades.
We sacrifice the soul's serene estate,
For hollow treasures that accumulate.",10,Gemini,0.361
I Knew a Woman,Sensuality,"I knew a woman, like a summer night,
Whose very presence filled the world with light
And shadow, mingled in a soft embrace,
A subtle power in her form and face.

Her voice, a murmur like a hidden stream,
Awakened longings in a waking dream.
Her touch, a spark that set the senses free,
A vibrant, earthy sensuality.

She moved with grace, a rhythm all her own,
A silent language beautifully shown.
Her laughter bloomed, a fragrant, heady wine,
That tangled every heart within its twine.

A force of nature, wild and yet refined,
The essence of all beauty intertwined.
She was the earth, in all her lush array,
A sensual promise at the close of day.",6,Gemini,0.43
The Darkling Thrush,Hope,"I leant upon a coppice gate
When Frost was spectre-gray,
And Winter's dregs made desolate
The weakening eye of day.
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky
Like strings of broken lyres,
And all mankind that haunted nigh
Had sought their household fires.

The land's sharp features seemed to be
The Century's corpse outleant,
His crypt the cloudy canopy,
The wind his death-lament.
The ancient pulse of germ and birth
Was shrunken hard and dry,
And every spirit upon earth
Seemed fervourless as I.

At once a voice arose among
The bleak twigs overhead
In a full-hearted evensong
Of joy illimited;
An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small,
In blast-beruffled plume,
Had chosen thus to fling his soul
Upon the growing gloom.

So little cause for carolings
Of such ecstatic sound
Was written on terrestrial things
Afar or nigh around,
That I could think there trembled through
His happy good-night air
Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew
And I was unaware.",6,Gemini,0.0
Sailing to Byzantium,Transcendence,"That is no country for old men. The young
In one another's arms, birds in the trees
—At their song-caught, mounted in that generation, at their dying—
The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
Caught in that sensual music all neglect
Monuments of unageing intellect.

An aged man is but a paltry thing,
A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal dress,
Nor is there singing school but studying
Monuments of its own magnificence;
And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
To the holy city of Byzantium.

O sages standing in God's holy fire
As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
And be the singing-masters of my soul.
Consume my heart away; sick with desire
And fastened to a dying animal
It knows not what it is; and gather me
Into the artifice of eternity.

Once out of nature I shall never take
My bodily form from any natural thing,
But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling
To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
Or set upon a golden bough to sing
To lords and ladies of Byzantium
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.",9,Gemini,0.064
Mirror,Identity,"I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
Whatever I see I swallow immediately
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
I am not cruel, only truthful—
The eye of a little god, four-cornered.
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
I think it is a part of my heart. But it flickers.
Faces and darkness separate us repeatedly.   

Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
Searching her reaches for what she really is.
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
I am important to her; she comes and goes.
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.",10,Gemini,0.428
The Good Morrow,Awakening,"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
Did, till we loved? were we not wean'd till then?
But suck'd on countrey pleasures, childishly?
Or snorted we in the seaven sleepers den?
T'was so; But this, all pleasures fancies bee.
If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desir'd, and got, t'was but a dreame of thee.   

And now good morrow to our waking soules,
Which watch not one another out of feare;
For love, all love of other sights controules,
And makes one little roome, an everywhere.
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
Let Maps to other, worlds on worlds have showne,
Let us possesse one world, each hath one, and is one.   

My face in thine eye, thine in mine appeares,
And true plaine hearts doe in the faces rest,
Where can we finde two better hemispheares
Without sharpe North, without declining West?
What ever dyes, was not mixt equally;
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I
Love so alike, that none doe slacken, none can die.",9,Gemini,0.096
Love Is a Place,Romanticism,"Love is a place & everything in it is you
you are the little shop of sweet &
amusing dreams which selling each
nobody buys only i & i buy whole & soulfully

all day long with not for
anything mind only for
you that you should
smell me from which i recede

nothing which we are to perceive
other can ever did that
sun blooms in my mouth
& goes down singing

no world
for us is as this
our day is our night
shall never be done",8,Gemini,0.385
When You Are Old,Aging,"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.",8,Gemini,0.0
The Lake Isle of Innisfree,Solitude,"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,
And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnight’s all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnet’s wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep heart’s core.",10,Gemini,0.014
To Autumn,Seasons,"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook;
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.",6,Gemini,-0.0
Ars Poetica,Poetry,"A poem should be palpable and mute
As a globed fruit,

Dumb
As old medallions to the thumb,

Silent as the sleeve-worn stone
Of casement ledges where the moss has grown—

A poem should be wordless
As the flight of birds.

A poem should be motionless in time
As the moon climbs,

Leaving, as the moon releases
Twig by twig the night-entangled trees,   

Leaving, as the moon behind the winter leaves
Memory of only three or four trees

That tremble, crumble, and fall upon the page.

A poem should not mean
But be.",7,Gemini,0.072
The Ghostly Spin,Memory,"The kitchen sways, a phantom, dizzy scene,
Where clumsy steps in waltz-time intervene.
My Papa's hand, a rough and calloused hold,
A story whispered, brave and yet untold.

The scent of whiskey, a faint, spectral trace,
Mingled with laughter in that vanished space.
A small boy clutched against a woolen vest,
A fleeting joy within a heart at rest.

The music fades, a distant, echoing strain,
A bittersweet and tender, loving pain.
That ghostly spin, a memory's embrace,
A father's love in time's forgotten space.",9,Gemini,0.537
The Emerald Cascade,Everyday Life,"The knife descends, a silver, rhythmic gleam,
Releasing life within the verdant stream.
I chop the parsley, emerald cascade,
A simple ritual, gently made.

The fragrant oils, a whisper in the air,
Of earth and sunshine, banishing all care.
This humble task, a moment held in hand,
A grounding beauty I can understand.

The steady rhythm, a familiar beat,
A quiet solace, bittersweet.
In daily acts, a poetry resides,
Where life's true essence softly hides.",9,Gemini,0.499
The Fallen Foe,Irony,"He sought the glory of a hero's name,
To strike the villain, end the wicked game.
He stood triumphant, blade held high and bright,
And saw his own reflection in the fading light.

The fallen foe, a mirror to his soul,
Revealing darkness taking its control.
The victory won, a hollow, bitter taste,
A hero's journey ending in disgrace.

The world looks on, with knowing, silent eyes,
At justice twisted beneath ironic skies.
The vanquisher, by vengeance overcome,
A tragic paradox, his battle done.",7,Gemini,0.574
The Empty Ascent,War,"An Irish airman climbs the morning sky,
A solitary figure, destined soon to die.
No burning hatred fuels his lonely flight,
Just duty's pull into the fading light.

The world below, a tapestry of green,
A life receding, a familiar scene.
He climbs above the clouds, a silent prayer,
Into the vastness of the empty air.

The engine's drone, a mournful, steady beat,
A prelude to a fate he's bound to meet.
No earthly quarrel claims his willing soul,
Just the cold mandate of a distant goal.",9,Gemini,0.467
The Stillness After,Mortality,"To an athlete dying young, the cheering fades,
Replaced by silence in the colonnades.
The swift-won race, the glory hard-attained,
Now lost to stillness, a life's bright course curtailed.

The laurel withers, victory's sweet renown
Surrenders to the quiet of the town.
The vibrant energy, the youthful grace,
Now held forever in time's cold embrace.

No further striving, no more races run,
His final victory, the stillness he has won.
A legend whispered on the passing breeze,
Of swift ascent and life's abrupt unease.",10,Gemini,0.348
The Crimson Stain,Rebellion,"Easter dawned, a fragile, hopeful start,
But soon the streets would tear the nation's heart.
A cry for freedom, bold against the crown,
A dream ignited in a bloodstained town.

The words were spoken, with a fervent fire,
Against the empire's long and harsh desire.
A stand was taken, brief and all in vain,
Leaving behind a legacy of pain.

The cobblestones absorbed the crimson stain,
A testament to courage and to pain.
A broken dream beneath a somber sky,
Where hope and sacrifice together lie.

Yet in that failure, seeds of change took root,
A whispered promise of a future fruit.
The cost of freedom, etched in sorrow's art,
A rebellion's echo in the nation's heart.",6,Gemini,0.458
The Enduring Song,Legacy,"The arrow flew, its purpose sharp and true,
A moment's action, swift and seen by few.
It found its mark, a point in time defined,
A consequence for body and for mind.

But with that arrow, song took to the breeze,
A melody that rustled through the trees.
It lingered softly, in the listener's ear,
A legacy of feeling, year by year.

The arrow's impact, fading into dust,
The song's vibration, born of pure trust.
One fades to memory, a moment past,
The other echoes, meant to ever last.

Let deeds be done with purpose clear and bold,
Like arrows flying, stories to be told.
But let our spirits leave a gentler trace,
The enduring beauty of a song's embrace.",10,Gemini,0.312
The Shared Flight,Friendship,"The arrow launched, a solitary aim,
To reach a target, whispered as a name.
Alone it soared, with focused, steady flight,
A single journey in the fading light.

But with that arrow, song arose and soared,
A shared vibration, deeply felt, adored.
Two spirits lifted on a common wing,
A harmony that only friends can sing.

The arrow's purpose, clear for all to see,
The song's ascent, a bond of you and me.
One finds its mark, the other finds its stay,
A deeper meaning lighting up the way.

Let purpose guide us, like the arrow's art,
But let our spirits intertwine, a beating heart.
For friendship's song, a melody so true,
Will carry us on journeys, me and you.",7,Gemini,0.347
The Mended Silence,Boundaries,"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
Yet year by year, the stones still rise and fall.
We build our barriers, with deliberate hand,
To separate our portion of the land.

The neighbor speaks, a ritual each spring,
Of mending gaps where ancient grudges cling.
A stubborn act, against the earth's soft pull,
Maintaining distance, making spirits dull.

The words are spoken, patching what's between,
But deeper currents often lie unseen.
A boundary marked, a space we will not cross,
A silent language counting every loss.

And though we mend, the impulse still remains,
To guard our hearts from shared joys and pains.
The wall stands witness, to a primal fear,
Of what might mingle, and what we hold dear.",10,Gemini,0.388
The Hourglass Heart,Carpe Diem,"To the young maidens, seize the fleeting hour,
For beauty blooms and fades, a fragile flower.
The sun climbs swiftly to its golden peak,
And youth's bright promise is both brief and weak.

Gather your joys before they drift away,
Like petals scattered at the close of day.
For time's swift current will not turn again,
And what is lost, no striving can regain.

No endless spring, no season without end,
But moments precious, quickly learned and spent.
So live with passion, let your spirits soar,
Before the darkness closes every door.

Embrace the sunlight, every vibrant hue,
Before the shadows claim what's rightfully due.
For life's a breath, a whisper on the air,
And time's a treasure beyond all compare.",9,Gemini,0.341
Subway Bloom,Imagism,"Sudden faces emerge,
Pale petals pressed
On night's wet branch.

A fleeting cluster,
Then darkness swallowed whole",7,Gemini,0.43
The Unmarked Plot,Class,"He came to work the land, with calloused hand,
A season's need upon a master's strand.
No kin to claim him when his strength gave way,
Just weary bones at the close of a long day.

He slept in shadows, ate at the far board,
A silent presence, seldom seen, ignored
Beyond the labor that his muscles lent,
A life unvalued, quickly spent.

And when the final stillness held him fast,
No grand farewell, no memories to last
In hearth or hall. Just earth turned over deep,
Where nameless workers find their final sleep.

The ledger closed, another season done,
The hired man vanished with the setting sun.
A life's brief chapter, easily erased,
A silent story in a forgotten space.",8,Gemini,0.569
The Arrow and the Song,Communication,"An arrow flew through open sky,
A message sharp, it aimed to try.
Yet softer still, a song took flight,
To reach the heart, not just the sight.

The arrow struck with force and will,
The song it danced, and lingers still.
One pierced the air with silent grace,
The other warmed a lonely place.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.244
Crossing the Bar,Farewell,"The tide draws out, a hush remains,
Beyond the bar, no worldly chains.
A twilight path where silence guides,
To seas where no dark fear abides.

No cries, no storms disturb the stream,
Just moonlit peace, a sailor's dream.
The harbor fades, the soul drifts free,
Into the arms of mystery.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.354
Design,Symbolism,"A spider weaves in quiet dread,
Above a moth, already dead.
The flower white, so pure, so still,
A symbol bent to nature’s will.

Each thread and wing and petal fair,
Conceals intent with thoughtful care.
The smallest signs in nature’s scheme,
Reflect a world not what it seems.",7,ChatGPT-4o,0.442
The Peace of Wild Things,Solace,"When night grows deep with heavy thought,
And all my hopes are overwrought,
I go where wild things cease to fear,
And silence hums both far and near.

A deer that grazes, calm and slow,
A stream that sings with steady flow.
Among the trees, I breathe and stand,
And peace returns with nature’s hand.",6,ChatGPT-4o,0.322
My Heart Leaps Up,Joy,"My heart leaps up when skies are gold,
When morning light breaks fresh and bold.
A rainbow arches far and wide,
A child's delight I cannot hide.

The joy of life in simplest form,
A sudden breeze, a summer storm.
For every dawn and dusk I see,
Awakes the youth still strong in me.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.339
Because I Could Not Stop for Death,Mortality,"He came not loud, but kind and slow,
A carriage ride where shadows grow.
No haste, no fear, no chilling breath,
Just silence walked the path with Death.

We passed the school, the grain, the sun,
Each moment still, no need to run.
And in that hush, I came to see,
Immortality rode next to me.",10,ChatGPT-4o,0.474
The Red Wheelbarrow,Imagism,"So much depends on moments still—
A wheelbarrow by windowsill.
Red paint gleams wet in morning rain,
Where silence rests in calm domain.

Beside white chickens pecking slow,
A humble truth begins to show.
In smallest things, the world can lie,
Beneath a quiet, watching sky.",6,ChatGPT-4o,0.51
Ozymandias,Impermanence,"A shattered face in desert bare,
Proclaims a king who’s no longer there.
‘Look on my works,’ the granite cried,
Yet all around, the winds replied.

No throne remains, no court, no blade,
Just drifting dunes where power decayed.
The might of men, though fierce and wide,
Falls silent where the ages bide.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.548
Mending Wall,Boundaries,"Stone by stone, the line is made,
A wall rebuilt though none invade.
Each spring we meet, yet still we part,
Divided by tradition’s heart.

Good fences make good neighbors still,
Yet wonder walks against that will.
What are we mending? What did fall?
Perhaps the wall. Perhaps it’s all.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.404
To Autumn,Seasons,"O autumn, rich in golden light,
You steal the fields in crisp delight.
With ripened fruit and amber skies,
You bid the summer's breath goodbyes.

The bees grow slow, the winds begin,
A hush prepares the frost within.
Yet in your quiet, life still sings,
A warmth before the slumber clings.",6,ChatGPT-4o,0.459
Those Winter Sundays,Parenthood,"His hands were cracked from winter's sting,
Yet still he rose, did everything.
The fires lit with morning blue,
A silent love in chores he’d do.

No thanks was said, no warmth returned,
Yet in that chill, his presence burned.
Now older, I can plainly see,
Love sometimes hides in duty’s plea.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.465
The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,Alienation,"Do I dare disturb the air?
Where thoughts like whispers fill the stair.
I measure life in coffee spoons,
And drown beneath indifferent moons.

The streets wind tight in twilight’s haze,
Where dreams decay in silent maze.
A voice within that dares not shout—
So much to say, forever doubt.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.541
The Lake Isle of Innisfree,Solitude,"I will arise and go once more,
To where the bee hums by the shore.
A cabin small, by stillness graced,
Where dreams and peace are interlaced.

Nine bean-rows near the quiet stream,
And starlight sings within a dream.
The city's cry may touch my ear,
But Innisfree is always near.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.253
Kubla Khan,Imagination,"In Xanadu, a vision stirred,
Where caverns deep through magic purred.
A stately dome by rivers ran,
Decreed and dreamed by Kubla Khan.

A pleasure-dome in sun and shade,
Where fantasies and fears cascade.
A fragment held in poet’s breath,
Of worlds unborn and life past death.",10,ChatGPT-4o,0.534
Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,Defiance,"Do not go soft where shadows creep,
Let fire burn while others sleep.
Though dying light may dim and fade,
Rage 'gainst the close, be unafraid.

The wise, the wild, the grave, the kind,
All feel the pull of time behind.
Yet in that dusk, make bold your fight,
And do not go without your light.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.515
I Heard a Fly Buzz—When I Died,Death,"The hush was thick, the stillness deep,
As mourners paused where silence weeps.
A fly broke through that sacred air,
A buzz that mocked the moment there.

The light had passed, the breath was gone,
Yet one small sound kept droning on.
A symbol strange, of life’s divide—
I heard a fly buzz—then I died.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.479
Ode to a Nightingale,Transcendence,"O nightingale, your song soars high,
Above the pain where mortals lie.

Lifts hearts where shadow cannot bide.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.463
Nothing Gold Can Stay,Ephemerality,"The morning's gold, so soft, so bright,
Must yield its crown to fading light.
The leaf, the flower, the sunlit ray—

We glimpse the truth, we feel desire.
Yet in that loss, we understand,
The golden hour is never planned.",9,ChatGPT-4o,0.488
Musee des Beaux Arts,Indifference,"While Icarus fell through silent skies,
No one paused, no anguished cries.

A blink within eternity.",8,ChatGPT-4o,0.529
The Raven,Madness,"A shadow perched above my door,
It whispered 'Nevermore' and more.

Still haunts me in the silence laid.",10,ChatGPT-4o,0.449
The Road Not Taken,Choice,"Two roads diverged in yellow wood,
And there I paused, as travelers should.

The quiet turn, the silent stake—
Shapes all the journeys we must take.",7,ChatGPT-4o,0.505
Chicago,Urban Life,"Hog butcher, stacker of the steel,
Your heartbeat forged on iron wheel.

Chicago, proud, and never tame.",6,ChatGPT-4o,0.669
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,Temptation,"These woods are dark and full of sleep,
Where snow falls soft, and silence deep.

With longing still within my chest.",7,ChatGPT-4o,0.413
The Waste Land,Disillusionment,"April wakes with cruel grace,

Howl,Rebellion,"I saw the minds ablaze with flame,
Caged by systems, stripped of name.

The rebel's voice beneath the shroud.",10,ChatGPT-4o,0.546
The Fish,Respect,"I caught a fish with scars like lines,
Each mark a tale, in scale designs.

Deserve the chance to just survive.",6,ChatGPT-4o,0.504
Birches,Memory,"I dream of birches bent by snow,

The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock (Revisited),Insecurity,"Shall I compare my thoughts to dust?
Each echo laced with aching trust.
In every glance, a doubt returns,

And lose myself in might-have-seen.",10,ChatGPT-4o,0.49
One Art,Loss,"The art of losing isn't hard,
Just misplace keys, a favorite card.

Hope is the Thing with Feathers,Hope,"Hope is a bird with endless tune,
