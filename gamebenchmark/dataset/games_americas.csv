Patolli,"Patolli is an ancient Aztec board game that takes its name from the Aztec word for bean - patolli, meaning fava or kidney bean. The game is played on a curious diagonal cross-shaped board with red and blue markers and 5 bean-shaped tokens as dice. Patolli was associated with gambling and players often wagered vast treasures on its outcome.

The game consists of throwing beans (dice) to bring tokens onto the board, and move them towards an exit ramp at the other end. Tokens are safe on some squares, but mostly can be ""eaten"" if an opposing player lands on them.

The Kirk edition of the game includes a 49-page booklet on the history and background to the game.",300,https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11691/patolli
Ulama,"The teams would face each other on the court. The object in the end was to get the ball through the stone hoop. This was extremely difficult, and so if it actually happened the game would be over. In fact, according to historian Manuel Aguilar-Morenao, some courts didn't even have rings. Another important rule was that the ball was never allowed to touch the ground. Players couldn't hold or even touch the ball with their hands - only the elbows, knees, hips and head were used. As you may imagine, this made for a very fast paced game, and the players had to constantly throw themselves against the surface of the court to keep the ball from landing. The players were skillful, and the ball could stay in the air for an hour or more.


Because it was so hard to get the ball through the hoops, there were other objects as well. Players could hit one of the six markers along the sides of the court. Or, they would be given points for other skillful plays. Fouls were also given if the players couldn't get the ball across the centre line, or if they touched the ball with the wrong part of the body, such as the hand or calf.",1400,https://www.aztec-history.com/aztec-ball-game.html
Snow Snake,"A game of snow snake is played by four teams, called ""corners"", who compete in trying to throw their wooden ""snow snakes"" the furthest along a long trough, or track, of snow. The game is divided into rounds, and in a round each team gets four throws. At the end of each round, two points are awarded to the team of the person who made the furthest throw, and one point is awarded for the second furthest throw. Play continues until one of the teams wins, by achieving a certain predetermined number of points (usually 7 or 11).[3]

There are two roles on a snow snake team: the Player, and the Goaler. The main role of a Goaler is to craft and maintain a team's wooden ""snow snakes"" in between games. The Goaler is also tasked with selecting which will be used for each throw during the game. A Player, meanwhile, is someone who throws the snow snakes during a game.",1500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_snake
Lacrosse/stickball,"The game was played by two teams with an equal number of men. The object was to get a tiny, walnut-sized, leather-covered ball through a goal using sticks shaped somewhat like small tennis rackets. The size of the field depended on the size of the teams and the availability of suitable terrain. The Cherokees were among the first to play consistently on a field about 100 yards in length, although some fields were much larger. There was no time limit; the first team to score 12 times won. Any strategy to score was acceptable, including biting, choking, and even banging each other on the head with the rackets. There were no time-outs or substitutions, but if a player was knocked out his opponent had to leave the game also.",1636,"https://www.ncpedia.org/stickball#:~:text=The%20game%20was%20played%20by,the%20availability%20of%20suitable%20terrain."
Double Ball,"Double Ball gets its name from two small balls that are attached to each other with a leather thong. The balls/thong are thrown and caught using a curved stick. Ball shape, size and materials varied by region, as did the specific rules. However, in general terms, the objective of the game was for one team to throw or “pass” the balls, using their sticks to catch the connecting leather thong and re-throw the balls on to another team member, making forward progress.

Points were earned by hitting a target, or goal established in each team’s “end-zone.” Often, this goal was a wicket, made of crotched poles about six feet tall, having a bar fastened across the top. The balls could not be allowed to touch the ground from the time an umpire tossed them into the air to begin play. The team that allows the balls to fall, loses a point.",1885,https://www.nps.gov/articles/traditional-game-double-ball.htm
Knuckle Hop,"In this game, the player takes a pushup position with his hands in fists so that all upper body weight is placed on the knuckles. The player then lifts up his legs and bounces forward on his fists and toes. The player who goes the furthest distance wins.",2006,"https://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/peoples-of-the-arctic/arctic-survival-skills-traditional-inuit-games#:~:text=Knuckle%20Hop,goes%20the%20furthest%20distance%20wins."
One-Foot High Kick,"In the high kick, a target (such as a bone or a piece of fur) is suspended at a given height. A player begins in a standing position, with both feet together, and jumps up to kick the hanging target with one foot, landing on the same foot that kicked the target. The player must maintain his balance on landing. All players attempt to kick the target in the same way, completing the first round. Players who do not successfully kick the target are eliminated. For the second round, the target is raised a few inches. Rounds are continued until one player remains",2006,"https://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/peoples-of-the-arctic/arctic-survival-skills-traditional-inuit-games#:~:text=Knuckle%20Hop,goes%20the%20furthest%20distance%20wins."
Ear Pull,This game tests competitors’ ability to endure pain. Two players sit on the floor facing each other. A loop of leather cord is strung between two of the players’ ears. Players then use their ear to pull on the cord until the cord comes free or the other player quits from the pain. This event can cause bleeding and some players require stitches. Some Arctic competitions have removed this event due to safety concerns.,1995,"https://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/peoples-of-the-arctic/arctic-survival-skills-traditional-inuit-games#:~:text=Knuckle%20Hop,goes%20the%20furthest%20distance%20wins."
Blanket Toss,"The blanket toss originated as a way for hunters to be able to see across the horizon but is now conducted for entertainment. Thirty or more people form a circle, holding the edges of a large skin or blanket, and toss a person into the air as high as possible. The object is to maintain balance and return to the blanket without falling over.",2006,"https://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/peoples-of-the-arctic/arctic-survival-skills-traditional-inuit-games#:~:text=Knuckle%20Hop,goes%20the%20furthest%20distance%20wins."
Sapo,Players attempt to throw coins or disks in the holes which score differently according to their difficulty. Disks that land successfully slide down to the front of the table to a compartment at the front of the table showing the score,2002,https://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Pitching-Discs.htm
Alaskan high kick,"The Alaskan High Kick is similar to the One- and Two-Foot High Kick in that the objective is to kick a hanging target. However, in this game, the player holds one foot with one hand, balances on the other hand, and then extends the other leg up to kick the target.",2006,"https://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/peoples-of-the-arctic/arctic-survival-skills-traditional-inuit-games#:~:text=Knuckle%20Hop,goes%20the%20furthest%20distance%20wins."
Anenjodi,"A post was erected in the middle of an area, and the one who managed to hit the target on top with a ball was awarded a prize",1591,"https://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/past-cultures/native-knowledge/games/#:~:text=Moccasin%20Game&text=This%20game%2C%20sometimes%20called%20the,moccasins%20by%20the%20other%20group."
Moccasin Game,"This game, sometimes called the hidden ball game, was played by two groups of men. The players sat opposite each other on a blanket. Four moccasins were placed in a row between the two groups. One of the groups watched as a token or ball was hidden under one of the moccasins by the other group. The players made pretenses of hiding and removing the token in an effort to make it more difficult to discover the actual location of the token. The group watching then guessed under which moccasin the token had been hidden. The Ojibwa, Ho-Chunk, and Menominee used a “striking stick” to turn over the moccasin where they thought the token was hidden. If the player guessed the correct shoe, four points were scored while four points were subtracted if the wrong shoe was picked. Sticks were used to keep track of the score.",1801,"https://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/past-cultures/native-knowledge/games/#:~:text=Moccasin%20Game&text=This%20game%2C%20sometimes%20called%20the,moccasins%20by%20the%20other%20group."
Chunkey,"In this game a chunkey stone was rolled over the ground or ice while several players threw spears in an attempt to indicate where the stone would stop rolling. The closest to the final location of the stone, without actually hitting the stone, was the winner.",600,"https://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/past-cultures/native-knowledge/games/#:~:text=Moccasin%20Game&text=This%20game%2C%20sometimes%20called%20the,moccasins%20by%20the%20other%20group."
Ojibiwa,One type of guessing game used small wooden sticks that were carved or painted with bands of color. The number of sticks varied from ten to more than a hundred and were divided into two bundles. The object was to guess the location of an oddly carved or painted stick. Another version would have involved guessing which bundle of sticks had more than the other.,1492,"https://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/past-cultures/native-knowledge/games/#:~:text=Moccasin%20Game&text=This%20game%2C%20sometimes%20called%20the,moccasins%20by%20the%20other%20group."
Batu,"Two teams of 12 men and/or women assemble in the center of a rectangular plaza or ball court. Each team has one goalie. The goalies try to stop the ball from passing or hitting their stone backrest or goal. Each team attempts to carry the ball from their side of the ball court to the opposing team's goal. The rubber ball used in Batey is called the Batu. The batu can not be touched with the hands. It can only be struck or kicked with the foot and/or bounced off of the thighs, legs and shoulders. The batu can also be bounced off of the surrounding stone walls of the batey ball court. A stone Yuke or Ceremonial Stone Belt was also used in the game. The players would also bounce the Batu off of the ceremonial stone belts that they wore around their waists. The minimum number of players permited in the game is 24. After that the number of players must be in multiples of 12",1492,https://www.taino-tribe.org/tribal-culture.html
Makebari.,In the game two men stand off and face each other in the center of a 9' circle. Each opponent attempting to strike each other's calves in a slapping motion with an open hand. Whoever succeeds in inflicting 9 strikes upon his opponent's calf muscle is deemed the winner. If any of the opponents are knocked out out side of the circle by their opponent they will automaticly lose the Makebari game,1492,https://www.taino-tribe.org/tribal-culture.html
Guamajico,"The children would squat around a 3' circle with their Guamajicos. The Guamajico are made from the seeds of the Algarrobo and/or Guama trees. The seeds are tied to a cord called a jico. The Guamajicos are placed within the center of the playing circle and each of the children holds the cord attached to their seeds. One of the children is picked by the group to start the game off by remove his or her Guamajico seed from the circle. This child then swings his or her seed down into the circle attempting to strike and break the other player's seeds. If the child's seed breaks he or she is out of the game. The next child does the same as they move in a clock wise direction, until all the seeds are broken. The child that has the unbroken Guama seed is deemed the winner of the game.",1492,https://www.taino-tribe.org/tribal-culture.html
Pelota mixteca,"The game of Pelota Mixteca dates from pre-Colombian times and is similar to the tennis, only with five players (sometimes nine) per team. It is played with a ball made of rubber, stocking thread and suede lining weighing about 330 grams. The players pound the ball back and forth using large, elaborately decorated suede gloves weighing between 7 and 12 pounds. The ball can only bounce once.

The game begins with a serve consisting of a rebound in a stone on the ground at the player's feet. The first rebound should land in a square called cajón at mid-field. The player called el Bolillero can return the ball without it hitting the ground, which is known as ""de Bolea"". Generally, the shots are so strong that at times the game is only carried out among the Bolilleros or between el Resto and el Contrarresto. It is hard to describe the shouting and the joy of the spectators when this happens. Only when the ball is intercepted in the center of the game field, the dispute is settled among los Rayeros. A match can last up to 4 hours.",1492,https://www.tomzap.com/mixtecball.html
Palin,"Two teams representing their communities, each one with the same number of players, between 5 and 15, placed in two rows facing each other, on a rectangular field which is 200 meters long and 12 meters wide. Its size is variable according to the number of players and the available space. We must remember that the length is always greater than the width. The bounds are marked either by means of thin trenches or with tree branches or shrubs, or even sawdust.

Playing sticks are made from different woods, and raw beech is preferred because of its hardness and consistency. It should be bent at one end. 

The team players are placed aligned next to each other facing the team that opposing it, is placed similarly. ""It is interesting to note that among the stick and ball games, palin is the only place where players in lateral position with respect to the goal lines-lines or xipalwe [tripalwe] - and of course this is the position most correct to drive the ball with the stick.

During the game, players are divided into three categories: defensive, attacking and Central Africa. The dignilfe is the player who moves to the center. On the left, we find attackers (tripalfe) and his defenders right (kacilfe). Another important detail is the that the number of defenders is always equal to the attackers. Thus, each camp or team always has an odd number of players, because it is also the center or dignilfe.",1492,https://hockeygods.com/hockeys/36-palin___the_chueca
Trompo,"The game, “spinning top” in English, consists of a top that’s spun by string wound around its body before being launched. Trompo players compete against one another by mastering difficult tricks, including the rollercoaster, drum roll, corkscrew and “stairway to Heaven”.",-3500,https://colombia.co/node/4003
Canicas,"pepo (when you throw your marble and hit an opponent’s) and manigus (when a child takes all the marbles and stops playing) Marbles are balls, usually glass, that come in different colors and sizes. There are dozens of different ways to play the game and the usual aim is to capture all your opponents’ marbles. ",-2500,https://colombia.co/node/4003
Balero,"consists of a small ball that’s attached to a wooden pin by a string. The ball has a hole pierced in it, which matches the diameter of the pin and is used to catch it",1301,https://colombia.co/node/4003
Cinco Huecos," best played in earth-covered village streets or in towns with a pot hole or two. Five players make four holes in a circle and one in the center, then retreat to a distance of around two meters. The players try to throw coins into the holes and the person who has scored the most coins in holes at the end wins. However, if one person throws all five of their coins into the center hole in one attempt, they win. Coins that land outside the holes are lost. ",25,https://colombia.co/node/4003
Tejo,"The game consists of throwing a metal puck/disc (called a tejo) across a field at a 1-by-1-metre (3.3 by 3.3 ft) board at a distance of approximately 18.5 metres (20.2 yd). The board is covered with clay and set at a 45-degree angle.

Wooden frames covered in clay act as a protective board to keep the tejo from hitting other elements or people in the neighboring area, and are called tablas. Inside the tablas, there is a metal pipe or car spring, designed to cushion the impacts of the tejo. This pipe is the target where the tejo is meant to hit. The pipe is set at the same angle as the frame (45 degrees).

The tejo must be thrown from within the throwing area, and the goal is to impact the inside of the target at the end of the field. A chief characteristic of the sport is its use of small, exploding targets that contain gunpowder, commonly known as mechas. These usually triangle-shaped envelopes with explosive material inside are set on the edges of the pipe. When struck by the tejo, they explode loudly, creating a sound similar to the one created by a small revolver. Modern adaptations of tejo also exist, with electronic sensors instead of the traditional mechas being used to detect a hit",1492,https://colombia.co/en/colombia-country/play-colombias-favorite-childhood-games
