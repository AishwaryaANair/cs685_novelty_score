Chaturanga,"Set-up

Ashtāpada, an uncheckered 8×8 board, sometimes with special markings, on which chaturanga was played
Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada,[13] which is also the name of a game. The board sometimes had special markings, the meaning of which are unknown today.[when?] These marks were not related to chaturanga, but were drawn on the board only by tradition. These special markings coincide with squares unreachable by any of the four gajas that start on the board due to movement rules. Chess historian H. J. R. Murray conjectured that the ashtāpada was also used for some old race-type dice game, perhaps similar to chowka bhara, in which the marks had meaning.

Rules
The initial position is as shown. White moves first. The objective in chaturanga is for one side (say 'white') to checkmate the opponent's raja (king) or to reduce the other side (say 'black') to just the raja ('bare king'), although if on the following move the black side can also reduce the white side to 'bare king', in which case the game is drawn.[14]. Pieces and their moves
Chaturanga pieces
Images        Name
        raja (king)
        mantri (minister) or senāpati (general) (Ferz; early form of queen)
        ratha or sakaṭa (chariot; rook)
        gaja or hastin (elephant; later called alfil; early form of bishop)
        aśva (horse; knight)
        padàti, bhata, or sainika (foot-soldier or infantry; pawn)
Raja (king): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga.
The general in Chinese xiangqi lacks diagonals, which might be the earliest move of the raja. The minority view that chaturanga developed from a form of xiangqi implies such an evolution, but it is also logical to assume such a move as the case for an Indian proto-chaturanga.
Mantri (minister); also known as senapati (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.
Ratha (chariot) (also known as sakaṭa) moves the same as a rook in chess: horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.
Gaja (elephant) (also known as hasti). Three different moves are described in ancient literature:
Two squares in any diagonal direction, jumping over the first square, as the alfil in Iranian shatranj, Ethiopian senterej, Mongolian Tamerlane chess and medieval courier chess. This is a fairy chess piece that is a (2,2)-leaper.
The same move is used for the boat in Indian chaturaji, a four-player version of chaturanga.[16]
The elephant in Chinese xiangqi has the same move, but is not able to jump over an intervening piece or pawn.
The elephant in Korean janggi has the same move, but outward from an initial orthogonal step, also without the ability to jump over an intervening piece or pawn.
One step forward or one step in any diagonal direction.
The same move is used for the khon (nobleman) in Thai makruk and the sin (elephant) in Burmese sittuyin, as well as for the silver general in Japanese shogi.
The move was described c. 1030 by Biruni in his book India.
Two squares in any orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) direction, jumping over the first square; raising the questions of whether the one step forward or one step in any orthogonal direction move for the gold general in Japanese shogi is a Japanese invention and whether the camel’s (1,3) move is, according to tradition, Tamerlane’s invention.
A piece with such a move is called a dabbābah[17] in some chess variants. The move was described by the Arabic chess master al-Adli[18][19][20][21] c. 840 in his (partly lost) chess work. (The Arabic word dabbāba in former times meant a covered siege engine for attacking walled fortifications; today it means ""army tank"".)
This is reminiscent of the aforementioned chaturaji, where the elephant moves as a rook.
The German historian Johannes Kohtz (1843–1918) suggests, rather, that this was the earliest move of the Ratha.
Ashva (horse): moves the same as a knight in chess.
Padati or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry); also known as sainika (warrior): moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move.[22]
Additional rules
Al-Adli mentions two further rules:

Stalemate was a win for a stalemated player. This rule appeared again in some medieval chess variants in England c. 1600. According to some sources, there was no stalemate, as the king is forced to move and consequently be captured.[23]
The player that is first to bare the opponent's king (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player's king on his next turn.

Gilli Danda," It was invented on the Indian Subcontinent & thought to have originated 2,500 years ago.
*This game is the root of some games, like Cricket, Softball, & Baseball.
 Material required:
 1. Two sticks - The smaller, oval-shaped wooden piece, 5 to 13 cm long & 2 to 3 cm in diameter & both ends pointed, is called a “Gilli”
& the longer one, 42 to 45 cm long & 3 to 4 cm in diameter & only one end pointed, is termed a “Danda”.
 2. Ground - No specific requirement of shape/size. Only a pit called Gali is required to put the Gilli to start the game.
 3. Players - No such binding two/more up to a hundred players of any age group above six years can play.
Instructions
1. The game starts by tossing - olisukhi.
2. The player who wins the toss starts first.
3. The player first places the Gilli on the pit & the pointed end of the stick -Danda is bent over
stick & hits the Gilli at the raised end, which flips it into the air.
4. While in the air, the player hits the Gilli as far as possible.
5. If a player standing in the field catches a stick hit by a player, then that player is dismissed.
6. Otherwise, the player earns points on the number of hits of Galli in the air & the distance between
the pit & the dropped Galli on the ground. Danda measures this distance.
7. Ultimately, the person or the team with the most points wins the game.
8. The secret to winning this game is in raising and hitting Gilli.",-300,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
Lagori,"1.Seven stones, probably flat stones.
2. Rubber ball
3. Ground- Outdoor area.
Players- The game is played between two teams- the seeker & the hitter, with a minimum of three players in each team.
In the World Cup Tournament, there are a total of twelve players in each team & only six players are on the ground for each set.
1. A total of three sets are played. Each set is of three minutes, followed by a half-minute break.
2. A pile of flat stones is placed in the middle of the ground.
3. One team member- the Seeker, throws a ball at a pile of stones to knock them over and then tries to
 restore the pile of stones while staying safe from the opposite team the Hitter's throws.
4. The Hitter’s aim is to hit the ball before the seekers reconstruct the stone pile. If the ball touches the Seeker
 that Seeker is out.
5. A Seeker can always safeguard themselves by touching an opposite team member before the ball hits the
 Seeker.
6. The Hitter cannot run with the ball to hit the Seeker.
7. To declare the reconstruction of the pile, the Seeker must say the game's name after restoring the pile of stones.
8. If the ball hits the pile & opposite member catches the ball, then the whole team is out.",-2975,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
Kanchey,"Material Required:
1. Dark green or multicolour marbles half to one inch in diameter.
2. Ground - It can play in a tiny place, outdoors or indoors. It requires a small pit & a circle measuring approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter. The game could
be played on any surface and weather.
3. Players - Two or more players of any age can play the game.
Instructions:
1. A circle measuring approximately 2-3 feet in diameter is drawn in the ground using a stick or a stone.
2. Each player contributes a minimum of two marbles each to begin the game. All the marbles are
collected at the centre of the circle.
3. Approximately three feet away from the hole there is a line & the players stand at the line and try to
throw their marbles into the pit. The person whose marble is closest to the pit gets to play first,
followed by the second nearest, and so on.
4. The players take turns shooting the marbles. The player shoots by holding the marble tautly in the
forefinger of the left hand, then stretching the finger back like a bow-string by the pressure of the
forefinger of the right hand, and finally by releasing the finger such that the marble flies forward.
5. The left thumb should always firmly touch the ground.
6. The players take turns knocking marbles out of the circle. They get to keep the marbles knocked out of the circle.
7. The game ends when no marbles are left in the circle.
8. The player with the highest number of marbles wins the game.
Variation: In a variation of the above game, the other players select the marble to hit once the marbles are collected in the circle's centre. If the player
hit the desired marble, he wins all the remaining marbles in the circle. The game continues similarly with the other players.",-2500,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
Langadi,"Material Required:
1. Ground- As such, no material is required. Only 10 to 18 meters of ground is needed.
2. Players- A minimum of two players can play this game as a pastime & for fun.
3. Anyone above three can play this game.
4. It is also a team sport. There are two sides, with twelve players on each side & an

Instructions:
1. A match lasts 36 minutes.
2. It is played in four innings of nine minutes each, with the teams alternating roles in each inning.
3. A coin toss is done before the game, with the team that wins the toss defending.
4. The chasing team sends chasers who hop on one foot and try to tag the defenders. The chasers can step out of the ground as long as they keep on one foot.
The defenders are declared out if they step out of the ground or commit a line fault
5. Once all defenders in the field are tagged, a new set of defenders enter the field from a designated entry zone, with the chaser required to go to the other
half of the field before tagging the latest defenders. If the chaser fails to remain on one foot, they leave the field, and a new teammate will come.
6. During the first turn that a team chases, their chasers must hop on their right foot, and then in their next chasing turn they must all hop on their left foot.
7. The team that tags the most defenders is declared the winner.",-2000,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
Tikkar,"Instructions:
1. One of the participants draws a playing court on a flat surface (usually the floor of alleys) with the help of a piece of coal or chalk.
A ladder shape pattern is drawn on the floor and every box is numbered from one to six or sometimes one to eight or ten.
2. The court's size depends upon the participants' wishes and may thus vary greatly. For example, if all the participants agree to have
a court of eight boxes two by four feet (0.61 by 1.22 m) each, that constitutes the playing court.
3. Once the playing court is ready, each participant takes turn.
4. Initially, the player stands backward at one side of the court and throws the stone blindly over her head so that it may land inside
the farthest box of the court.
5. If it lands successfully inside the designated box (without touching any lines) of the court, the player stands barefoot near that piece
of stone with one foot in the air
6. She pushes the stone (in a single try) to attempt to slide it into the adjoining box. If successful (once again without touching any
of the lines), then the player carries on doing the same until the piece of stone is successfully out of the court and the player
is back at the place from where she threw the stone.
7. Once successfully out of the court, the player may stand on both feet.
8. Consequently, the player's turn prematurely ends when the player can no longer stand on one foot and both feet touch the court,
or stone touches the line, on the line, or out of the court.",-1700,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf

MALLAKHAMB,"Material Required:
1. There are three variations of Mallakhamb-
 Pole Mallakhamb
 Hanging Mallakhamb
 Rope Mallakhamb
Both men and women practiced all variations.
 Pole Mallakhamb--A vertical wooden pole made of teak wood or sheesham, of 2.6 meters in height with a
circumference of 55 centimeters at the base and gradually tapers to 35 centimeters at the top and is fixed to the ground
and smoothened with castor oil, which helps to minimize excessive friction.
 Hanging Mallakhamb-- It is a smaller version of fixed Mallakhamb. It is suspended with the aid of hooks and chains.
The bottom of the pole doesn’t touch the ground.
 The swinging and revolving motion makes it quite difficult.
 Rope Mallakhamb- A thick rope is suspended vertically, 5.5 meters long, and 2centimeters in diameter.
 Players- One or more players can perform on the same pole or rope.
Instructions:
Both men and women practiced all variations.

3. The player/ gymnast performs aerial yoga postures, different positions, and exercises and holds their
positions longer.
4. Before beginning Rope Mllakhamb, warming up the body muscles is necessary.
4. Training and practice are necessary to perform this sport. It is essential to take safety precautions.
5. It is essential to do it slowly at first.
6. It is a strenuous kind of workout that may exhaust the body, so rest days are essential.
7. While performing this sport, it is essential to maintain the body’s hydration.",1101,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
CHAUPAR,"Material Required:
 The board of any material, wooden or embroidered cloth, in the shape of a cross, each arm is divided into three adjacent columns of eight squares
s
 Three squares on each arm are highlighted with a cross or some other distinguishing mark - the middle square at the end of each arm and the fourth square
from the end of the arm on either side. These squares are called castles. The middle of the cross forms a large square called the Charkoni.
 Sixteen beehive-shaped pieces (songati/ men) are used: four in black, four in green, four in red, and four in yellow.
 Six small cowry shells.
 A maximum of four players play this game, each sitting in front of an arm of the cross. The center of the cross is ghar or home.
Instructions:
 The starting point for each player is the flower motif on the column to the left of their home column.
 To start, each player takes turns throwing the cowry shells. The player with the highest score starts first.
 Each player must enter four men into the game from the starting point. The men travel around the outer perimeter columns in an anti-clockwise direction.
 Before a player can bring any of his men home, he has to knock out at least one man of another player. This is called a tohd. Only the player's own men
can enter the home column of each player. Once the men cross the flower motif, they are played by laying the pieces on their side to indicate they are in
their final home stretch and are safe now from any further attack.
A score of 25 points- All seven cowry shells are used in each throw",-1000,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
LATTOO,"Material required:
 The tops were made of clay earlier and later replaced with wood/plastic. However, with technological advancement,
one can find many different varieties and colours of tops today in the market. Some are with lights and sound effects.
 A nail- the wooden top is mounted on the nail.
 A string- to spin the top and also pick the top the string is used.
 The string is tied across the top.
 Players- can be played alone or in groups.
Instructions:
 There are various modifications & techniques associated with this simple-looking yet scientific game, like, lifting the
moving top off with the string, rolling the top on the string, and many more.
 There are no set rules. A group of kids decide the rules.
 Smaller tops have a short stem and are set in motion by twirling it using the fingers. A thumbtack may also be made
to spin on its tip similarly.
 They may be set in motion by twirling a handle with the fingers, by pulling a rope coiled around the body,
or using a built-in auger.
Physics in the game:
 A spinning top, or simply a top, is a toy with a squat body and a sharp point at the bottom, designed to be spun on its vertical axis,
balancing on the tip due to the gyroscopic effect. Once set in motion, a top will usually wobble for a few seconds, spin upright for a
while, then wobble again with increasing amplitude as it loses energy, and finally tip over and roll on its side. The motion of a top is
described by equations of rigid body dynamics, specifically the theory of rotating rigid bodies. Because of the small contact area
between the tip and the underlying surface and the large rotational inertia of its body, a top that is started on a hard surface will usually
keep spinning for tens of seconds or more, even without additional energy input. Typically, the top will wobble until friction and
torque between the tip and the underlying surface force it to spin with the axis steady and upright. The total spinning time of a top
is generally increased by increasing its moment of inertia and lowering its center of gravity.",-3500,https://worldforumfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Traditional-Indian-Games-By-Dr.-Swati-Kela-India-Vancouver-2024.pdf
Nondri,"Usually, a series of boxes that are connected with each other is drawn with the first three boxes being single followed by two connected boxes and one single box, with the last two boxes connected. The boxes look like a series of three boxes stacked on top of each other (The Top Section), which is stacked on two boxes placed touching each other that are stacked on a single box (The Middle Section) which are stacked on the bottom section of two touching boxes (The Bottom Section). The person to pass through each boxes through hopping and walking with eyes closed without touching the borders is the winner. There are different levels the player has to pass through in order to become the ultimate winner.

Usually a group of players of up to 4 players (although there can be any number of players involved) decides by playing Saa-boo-Three on who should start first. The first player throws the rubble in the 1st box, without touching the corners and has to hop directly from the start line to Box 2 without touching the first box and has to hop from Box 2 to Box 8, not spending more than 10 seconds in each box and has to repeat the process in reverse, where he collects the rubble in the first box only with one hand and jumping straight to the starting point. the person who does this step without any fumbles is eligible to the next box. This time the rubble has to be thrown at the 2nd Box and repeat the process again but he is allowed to hop on Box 1 and stay as long as he wants (although most won't take more 15 seconds) as he has conquered that box. The Process goes on until he conquers all eight boxes. However, a person is out if he touches edges of any box in his attempt or he throws the rubble in other boxes than the one which he is supposed to throw. The Players take turn until a winner is emerged. There is high possibility for a person to win without other players getting turn.",-3500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondi
Atya Patya,"The game is played in four innings (turns), with each inning lasting for seven minutes, and the teams alternating attacking and defending roles in each inning. Before each inning, the defensive team places one player in each of the trenches. A batch of four players on the attacking team,[23] who are referred to as ""assailants"", line up at one end of the court, in the area in front of the front trench. The goal of the assailants is to score by crossing each trench without being eliminated; the total number of points scored in an inning by the attacking team is equal to the number of trenches crossed by their furthest-advancing assailant.[18] If an assailant is touched by a defender (and the defender commits no faults, such as stepping out of their trench, or lifting a foot at or immediately after the time of tagging the assailant), then the assailant is ""out"", and must leave the court.[24][25] The assailant is also out if they step out of the field while failing to keep any part of their body grounded within the field.

If an assailant crosses all nine trenches, they may say the word ""Tond"", which compels the defenders to turn around, allowing the assailant to now attempt to re-cross the nine trenches in the opposite direction.[26] If an assailant manages to cross all nine trenches in both directions, a ""Lona"" is said to have been scored, meaning that 18 points have been scored by the attacking team for the 18 times that assailant crossed a trench;[18] after a Lona has been scored, the not-out assailants are brought back to the starting area and then allowed to continue scoring for the remainder of the inning.[26][15]

Atya-patya matches are decided on a best-of-three basis",-300,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atya_patya
Ball Badminton,"A match consists of three games. The team that wins two out of three games is the match winner. The team first scoring the 34th point wins a game. Teams start each game from the side opposite the one they played the previous game. There is a break of two minutes between the end of the first game and the start of the second game, and five minutes between the second and the third games. Choice of side and the right of first service is decided by a coin toss at the beginning of a match. If the team winning the toss chooses to serve, the other team has the choice of side and vice versa. At the beginning of a match the referee allows two trials, one from each side. After the trials are over, the umpire shall call ""play"" and regular play begins. A ball is in play from the time a player attempts to serve until it touches the ground or until a ""fault"" or ""let"" (a re-serve) is called by the umpire.

The officiating team consists of one umpire, two or more line referees and a scorer. When the umpire calls ""play"", if a team refuses to play it forfeits the match. The umpire is the sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is the umpire's responsibility to call ""fault"" or ""let"", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls ""fault"" and immediately corrects himself and calls ""play"" but the striker fails to return the ball, a ""let"" is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and one half of the side line opposite the umpire, in addition to any other duties assigned by the umpire. Referees signal the umpire in a code prescribed by the BBF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. The umpire can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.

The umpire is also responsible for the net. He announces the score (for the benefit of the scorer) when a point is scored or a server is out. In announcing the score he calls the number of the serving hand, followed by the score of the serving team and the score of the other team. If a match is suspended by the umpire for any reason (e.g. weather and light), it is resumed from the point at which it was stopped. In case of a tie between two or more teams in any tournament, a match is not replayed. If the tie is unbroken, teams are ranked based on game and point scores. In a league tournament, if two (or more) teams have identical won/lost records their game scores are used to break the tie.",1856,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_badminton
Gutte,The game is played in 5 rounds. Generally for first 4 rounds four stones are thrown on the floor. First round is to pick up 4 stones one by one. Second round is to pick 2 stones at a time. Third round is to pick 3 stones together and then pick one. Fourth round is to pick all four in one go. Last round is to toss all the stones from palm and place it on the back of the palm and then catch all four by tossing to above.,-2500,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knucklebones#South_Asia
Kho kho,"At the start of play, the active chaser starts off in one of the free zones, and can run into either half of the court to tag the three defenders. Once all three defenders have been tagged out or otherwise ""dismissed"", the next ""batch"" of three defenders comes onto the court.[28]

The active chaser can switch roles with a sitting teammate by touching them on the back and shouting ""kho""; this is known as the active chaser ""giving a kho"" to the sitting teammate. One kho must be given by the active chaser upon the dismissal of a batch before the chasing team can tag any players in the next batch.[5] For the kho to be valid, it must be given before the active chaser has gone past the cross lane that the teammate is sitting within, with the sitting teammate not moving/rising before receiving the kho. Once a sitting chaser becomes active, they may only enter the half of the court which they were facing while they were sitting; additionally, once the newly active chaser steps to the left or right of the cross lane they were sitting in (or turns in such a way that their shoulders face towards either pole), they must continue in that direction until they have reached the free zone. Also, once the newly active chaser steps out of the central lane, they cannot step back into the central lane while tagging a defender.[28]

Violating any of these rules results in a ""foul"", in which case the chasing team can no longer attempt to tag any defenders. In order to clear the foul, the active chaser must move in the opposite direction of the one they were running in (i.e. away from the defenders they were chasing) until they have either given a kho to a teammate, or reached the appropriate free zone.[28]

The chasing team scores points each time a defender is ruled ""out"" (dismissed), which happens either when a chaser tags a defender without breaking any rules, when a defender steps out of the court (with no part of the body remaining grounded within), or when a defender is late to enter the court as part of a new batch after the dismissal of the previous batch.[28][29]

In the case of a tie, some matches have a tiebreaker known as a ""minimum chase"", in which each team is allotted an additional turn to score. Each team's turn ends once they have scored one point, with the team that is faster at scoring a point during their minimum chase turn winning the match",-301,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
chor police,"Since the game revolves around cops and thieves, police has to catch the thieves in order to defeat opposite team. Once the team is defeated after a successful run-and-catch, police has to play the role of thieves and hence thieves become police and it continues vice versa until the game ends",2008,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
oonch neech,"After chain-cut, a person, say A is chosen as Denner or catcher. The playing members will ask the Denner : 'Oonch neech ka papada—Oonch mangi ki neech?' meaning ""do you want the upper level or the lower level?"" The catcher chooses either Oonch (any height) or Neech (ground). Usually he chooses Neech, so as to move. Once A chooses Oonch, he should not step on Neech by any means and on the other hand, he will not let other players to step on his ground. If B stays on ground by mistake and if he is captured by A, then B becomes the catcher in the next game.

In the game, other players tease the catcher by saying ""Hum tumhari Neech pe or Hum tumhari Oonch pe"" which mean ""We're in your area, catch us"". In Telugu, it is translated as ""Nee nelanta pappu suddha"" or ""Nee bandanta pappu suddha"". The catcher is asked by the players ""Which area do you want? Oonch (up) or Neech (down)?"". The catcher chooses the area as per his convenience",2008,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
steal the bacon,"The players are divided into teams, typically two. Players are assigned a call-sign, often a number, which is shared by a member of the opposing team. The teams line up on opposite edges of the playing area, at a distance enough to run across from each other, which has the ""bacon"" (a small object which can be grabbed and carried) in the center. A referee calls out the call-sign, and the team members who have that call-sign must run to the center, grab the bacon, and return to their teammates without being tagged by the other player(s) with that call-sign.[4] The one that manages to return with the object to his/her team gets a point. If tagged, the other team gets the point. Tagging of a player may not occur before that player has touched the ""bacon"". The referee may call out more than one call-sign resulting in many pairs of players, each player attempting to steal the ""bacon."" The referee may also call ""steal the bacon"" in which all players on both sides may attempt to steal the ""bacon.""",2008,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Surr,"The game is played on a rectangular field, divided into four equal quadrants, by two teams of two to four players each.[1] The attacking team gathers in one quadrant, and the defending team gathers along the quadrant's borders with the adjoining quadrants. The objective of the attacking team is to enter the other quadrants without being touched by the players of the defending team. If all the members of the attacking team manage to enter all the quadrants, the attacking team wins, and its members shout ""Bol Den Goivan Surr!"".[3] In an Awadhi variation, they sing ""Bol Goiyan Banva Surr"" (""बोल गोइयां बणवा सुर्र"");[1] if they are touched by the defending team, they lose, and have to stand on the quadrant line as ""thieves"", and have to sing another phrase",2014,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Kite flying,"Competitors try to capture their opponents kite and bring it to the ground. Expert kite fighters are able to cut their opponent's line and then encircle the trailing line (lubjow) of the cut kite. Once secured, the winner can then fly both kites and pull in the prize. If the cut kite is not captured, then the kite belongs to no-one, and ""kite runners"" - typically younger children - will attempt to pursue and claim it.",-200,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Pacchisi,"Each player's objective is to move all four of their pieces completely around the board, counter-clockwise, before their opponents do. The pieces start and finish on the Charkoni.

The playing order is decided by each player throwing the cowries. The player with the highest score starts, and turns continue counter-clockwise around the board. In some versions, each player throws the cowrie shells and pieces cannot move until a 2, 3, or 4 is thrown.

If a 6, 10, or 25 is thrown, the player gets a grace, which enables the player to introduce one of their pieces from the Charkoni onto the board. The player then repeats their turn. In other versions, this includes 10, 25, or 35 to introduce another of their pieces. The newly introduced pawn will be landed on square number 1, which is the very first square for every respective player: here, it is said that on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you will introduce your new pawn at square number 1, and then you will add the second throw numbers that will be appeared on your cowries and 7, 14 as a grace without the introduction of pieces (here, it should be clear to players that on throwing 7 or 14, you can not introduce your new pawn, you only get an extra turn). A player needs to have at least one piece on the board to be able to throw a 7 or 14.

Simply put, on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you can not introduce your new pawn directly to 10 or 25, or 35 number square directly, you have to land the new pawn on square number 1 and then add your remaining numbers. Once your all pawns have entered the game, throwing 10 or 25, or 35 allows you to move the respective numbers ahead.

Each player's first piece may leave the Charkoni on any throw after it has been introduced onto the board. Each player moves their pieces down the centre column of their own arm of the board, then counter-clockwise around the outside columns.

A player may have any number of pieces on the board at one time. Only one piece may be moved with a single throw, or if the player chooses, they can decline to move any piece on a throw. In some versions, a player can move any number of their pieces with a single throw. Also, if the player casts a value higher than they are eligible to move in a single throw, then the player automatically loses that turn.

More than one piece of the same team may occupy a single square (not true for all squares in some versions). However, a piece may not move onto a castle square that is already occupied by an opponent's piece.

If a piece lands on a square (other than a castle square) occupied by any number of the opponent's pieces, those pieces are captured/killed and must return to the Charkoni. Captured pieces may only enter the game again with a grace throw. A player making a capture is allowed another turn (not true in some versions).

In some versions, a player cannot take their pieces back to the Charkoni/home, unless they have captured/killed at least one of the opponent's pieces. Some versions have a rule where if, for example, two players are playing against each other, and Player 1 captures a piece of Player 2, then Player 2, in their immediate turn after being captured for the first time, captures the same piece Player 1 just used to capture, in the same square where the capture took place, then Player 1's capture/kill is invalidated. Player 1 will need to recapture Player 2's piece again to be able to go back to the Charkoni, but Player 2 is free to go ahead to their respective Charkoni unless the above repeats.

A piece completes its trip around the board by moving back up its central column. Returning pieces may be placed on their side in order to distinguish them from pieces that have just entered. A piece can only return to the Charkoni by a direct throw.

Four of the castle squares are placed so they are exactly 25 moves from the Charkoni. A common strategy is for returning pieces to stay on these squares, where they are safe from capture until a 25 is thrown. The pieces can then finish the game directly. This is where the name of the game comes from.

In some versions, where more emphasis is put on the throwing of the cowries, experienced players can cause cowries to land in a specific way, so there are certain other rules to make the game more exciting.

If a player has their pieces closer to the end, and does not need a higher value throw, there are ways to nullify the higher value throw.
If the player casts a 10, 25, or 30, the player needs to consecutively throw either 10, 25, or 30 three times (including the original throw) to nullify the higher value throw.
If the player casts a 7, the player must consecutively cast a 7 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
If the player casts a 14, the player must consecutively cast a 14 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
Since throwing three consecutive throws of 10, 25, or 30 in a single turn nullifies them, players can instead throw a 7 or 14 in between to keep their turn going. EX: A player can throw the following in a single turn: 25, 25, 14, 10, 30, 7, 25, 30, 7, 10, 14, 25, 3.
Once all of the player's pieces are introduced onto the board, every time a player throws a 10, 25, or 30, the player must move their piece one additional square, which is known as PYADA. EX: A player casts 25, 25, 3 in their turn, and their pieces can move a total of 53 squares. However, when all the player's pieces have already been introduced onto the board, the player can then move a total of 55 squares (25+25+3+1+1), meaning 2 pyadas extra.",1860,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
"Aadu Puli Aatam
","This is a game played by two people or two teams. One player is the goat (defender) and the other, the tiger (challenger). In the most popular version of the game, the challenger has three tigers, while the defender has 15 goats. The challenger has to kill five goats, while the defender tries to surround the three tigers in such a way that the challenger cannot make a move. The game begins with the two players taking turns to place their game pieces on the board. After three turns, when all the pieces representing the tiger have been placed on the board, the tiger is free to move. The player representing the goat must wait till all 15 game pieces representing goats have been placed on the board. The movement of the pieces should be along the lines and one place at a time. Cutting or killing a goat can be done by jumping over it to land on an empty space behind. As the tiger can move first, it is imperative for the player representing the goats to place the game pieces with care. The game involves concentration, skill and strategic thinking. An etching of the game at the Yeri Katha Ramar temple in Chennai (Kreeda) Multiple jumps are not allowed, nor is it permitted to jump over two game pieces at a time. As the tiger can move first, it is imperative for the player representing the goats to place the game pieces with care. The game involves concentration, skill and strategic thinking. The key aspect that distinguishes hunt games from others is that they are asymmetrical. The two sides neither have the same number of game pieces and moves, nor the same aims. And yet, they are equally balanced. In this game, one player has three tigers and the other 15 goats. The aim of the tiger is to kill the goats and the aim of the goats to surround the tigers so they cannot move. The tigers kill by jumping over a goat, while a goat cannot jump at all. So, what we have is different aims, different number of game pieces and different types of moves.",1600,https://thebridge.in/straight-out-of-pages/tiger-goat-game-tamil-nadu-temples-33661
Moksha paatam,"The goal of the game is to reach Perfection, or Nirvana—the highest place for a human being—which is
at the top of the game board.
This is a shortened version of the classic game, designed to be played in 20 minutes by 2 or more players
(more players make the game last longer).
Equipment needed:
In addition to the game board, you will need a
standard 6-sided die and playing pieces. For playing
pieces, you can use ordinary game pawns; but if you
don’t have game pawns, coins (penny, nickel, dime,
quarter) work well.
Rules:
1. The players take turns throwing the die, and
moving the number of spaces shown.
2. If a player lands at the foot of a ladder, they
climb to the top of the ladder and take another turn.
3. If a player lands at the head of a snake, they
slide back down to the tail end. Each snake is named
for a character from Hindu mythology (you can find
short descriptions of each character below).
4. If a player rolls a 1 or a 6, they then take another
turn. If they roll a 1 or 6 and land on the head of a
snake, they first slide to the tail of the snake, then take
another turn. If they roll a 1 or 6 and land at the foot of
a ladder, they first climb the ladder, then they take another turn (for having climbed the ladder), then still
another turn (for having rolled a 1 or a 6).
5. Players must get to Perfection by exact count.
For example, if you are on square 78 you must roll a 3
to get to Perfection; if you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you must
stay on square 78; if you roll a 1 or 2, you may advance
that number of squares.
6. The first player to reach Perfection wins.",-200,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Pallankuli,"Pallankuli is played on a rectangular board with 2 rows and 7 columns. There are a total of 14 cups (kuḻi in Tamil) and 148 counters. For the counters in the game, seeds, shells, small stones are all common for use.[7] As the game proceeds, each player distributes the shells over all the pits. The players may capture the shells, as permitted by the rules of the game. The rules of capture depend on the variant of the game played. The game ends when one of the players captures all the shells, and is declared as a winner.

12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction.

If, after having a counter dropped into it, a cup contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped the counter (pasu in Tamil). The round is over when no counters remain.

Once the first round is over players take the counters from their stores and fill as many of their holes as possible with counters. The winner will have a surplus of counters which are kept in his store. The loser of the first round will be unable to fill all of his holes. These unfilled holes are marked as ""rubbish holes"". In the next round play continues as before, but without the rubbish holes being included and the player who went first in the previous round going second.

During the game if a player has enough counters to fill any of his rubbish holes back up their status is removed and they are again used during play. The game is over when a player is unable to fill any cups with six counters at the end of a round",900,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Antakshari,"The game can be played by two or more people and is popular as a group activity during commutes, and social gatherings. The first singer has to sing two complete lines and then s/he may stop at the end of those or following lines. The last letter of the last word sung is then used by the next singer to sing another song, starting with that letter. The winner or winning team is decided by a process of elimination. The person or team that cannot come up with a song with the right consonant is eliminated if their opponents can produce such a song.",1900,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
Raja Mantri Chor Sipahi,"The game begins with making 4 chits namely Raja (2000 points), Mantri (900 points), Chor(0 points) and Sipahi (700 points). Each chit is folded-shuffled and distributed among 4 players with each player picking one chit. Players can open their respective chit to find out their character(which shall not be revealed to anybody). The Sipahi then has to identify the ‘Chor’ from the other 3 players whether they are a “chor” or not. If the Mantri, guesses correctly then the points are retained or else he/she surrenders them to the Chor. If the Sipahi picks the wrong person then the Chor and Sipahi will have to switch points. Several rounds of this game are played before counting the points. The player with the highest score wins the game",1980,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_of_India
