football,1863,"The sport is played with a round ball (traditionally with black and white checks), which is only kicked by the feet. This excludes the goal keeper, who can use hands only in the goal area. A goal is scored when an attacking player kicks the ball into the opposition net. Games are usually low scoring. There are 11 players on the field, with some substitutions coming late in the game. If a player is substituted off they can not come back onto the field. The game consists of 45 minute halves, with a half time break.

A List of Rules
A football match is played by two teams, with each allowed no more than 11 players on the field at any one time, one of whom is a goalkeeper.
A match is played in two 45 minute halves.
The game begins with the toss of a coin, and the winning captain decides which goal to defend or to take the first kick off.
All players must use their feet head or chest to play the ball. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated goal area.
The aim of the game is to score a goal, which is achieved by kicking or heading the ball into the opposition team's goal.
If the ball completely crosses the side line, it is thrown back in by the team that was not the last to touch the ball.
The game is controlled by a central referee, and two linesmen. They award free kicks and penalties when rules are broken. For continual breaking of rules or for a bad foul, the player may shown a red card and be sent off.",www.rulesofsport.com
rugby,1845,"The game is broken down into two 40 minute halves with a 10 minute rest period in between. The game carries no stoppage time and will end exactly on 80 minutes.
Each team can start with 15 players and up to 7 substitutes. Players that have left the field are only allowed to return if they have been treated for an injury.
The field must be roughly 100 metres long and 70 metres wide with a minimum of a 10 metre dead ball area. The H shaped goal needs to be 6 metres wide with no restrictions on height.
The field consist of the following markings; half way line, 5 metre line, 22 metre line, 10 metre line and dead ball line. Also included is a centre spot for restarting the game after a try, penalty or drop goal has been scored.
The game must have one referee and two touch judges. It’s the referee’s job to time keep, make decisions throughout the game and keep order on the field. The two touch judges can assist the referee with decisions and also notify the referee when players are in touch (out of playing boundaries).
The game will stop if a player is fouled, the ball goes out of play or a try or drop goal is scored.
The defending team must tackle a player by grabbing a hold and pulling them to the floor. A tackle cannot be made above shoulder height and doing so will cause the referee to award a foul.
Once the ball goes into touch a line out is called. Up to 7 players can enter a line out and any of these players can be lifted in order to catch the ball being thrown in. Both teams can compete to win the ball.
A successful conversion, penalty or kick at goal only occurs when the player manages to kick the ball through the top section of the goal. If a player is unsuccessful the ball is still in play until it crosses one of the playing fields boundaries.
Attacking players must remain behind the ball whilst active or run the risk of being called offside. Players not interfering with play can be in front of ball but must get back behind the ball before then again interfering with play.",www.rulesofsport.com
cricket,1744,"Players: Each team has eleven players, including a captain, and they take turns playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding).
Innings: In cricket, each team takes turns batting and fielding. A full game (test match) consists of two innings per team, with the exception of some shorter formats of the game such as ODIs and T20s. (see types of cricket)
Equipment: The equipment used in cricket includes a bat, a ball, and wickets. The bat is flat on one side and can be no more than 38 inches in length. The ball is typically made of cork, covered in leather, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces. Wickets are made of three wooden stumps and two bails.
Scoring: The basic way to score runs is by hitting the ball and running to the opposite end of the pitch. If the ball is hit to the boundary, a four or six runs are awarded depending on whether it bounces before crossing the boundary or not. The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
Bowling: The bowling team takes turns bowling the ball to the batsmen, and the objective is to hit the wickets or get the batsmen out in another way (see ways of getting out). The bowler must not throw the ball but instead bowl it overhand with a straight arm.
Batting: The batting team tries to score runs while protecting their wickets. Each batsman takes turns facing the bowler, and the objective is to hit the ball and score runs. A batsman is out if they hit the ball in the air and it is caught by a fielder, or if the ball hits the wicket and the bails are dislodged (there are other less common ways of getting out too).
Extras: If a no-ball or a wide ball is bowled, the batting team is awarded an extra run (but the score is not credited to the batsman). Other extras are byes and leg byes, and penalty runs.
Fielding: The fielding team tries to take wickets and prevent the batting team from scoring runs. Fielders can catch the ball or stop it and throw it to the wickets to get a run-out.",www.rulesofsport.com
gaelic football,1855,"Inter-county matches consist of two 35-minute halves, while club games are 30 minutes per half.

In Gaelic football, players are allowed to carry the ball in their hands and it can be kicked or hand-passed. After every four steps the player must bounce or solo the ball. A solo involves dropping the ball onto your boot and kicking it back into your hand. You cannot bounce the ball twice in succession but you can solo as many times as you wish. The ball cannot be lifted straight off the ground - a player must put his boot under it.

Shoulder-to-shoulder contact is permitted, while a player can slap the ball out of an opponent's hand. More than one player can tackle the player in possession but their tackle must be aimed at the ball. Deliberate body contact such as punching, tripping, jersey pulling or a full frontal charge is forbidden, as is blocking an opponent's shot with the foot.

In hurling, the ball can be struck on the ground or in the air - with the hurley or boot - but it must be lifted off the ground with your hurley. The ball can be carried in your hand for a maximum of four steps. After that you can bounce the ball on the hurley and back to your hand, but you cannot catch the ball more than twice. Players get around this by balancing the ball on their hurley while running.

Players can block an opponent's strike using their hurley. They can also hook a player's hurley as he is attempting the strike the ball. Like football, shoulder-to-shoulder contact is also permitted.


Scoring
A goal is scored when the ball crosses the goalline between the posts and under the crossbar, while a point is scored when the ball goes over the crossbar. A goal is the equivalent of three points. Teams' scores are written in a goals-points format. For example, 2-10 is two goals and 10 points, which is a total of 16 points.

A goal is signalled by the umpire raising a green flag, while a white flag signals a point. The game restarts with the goalkeeper kicking out the ball from the 13-metre line.",https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/gaelic-football/news/30546/9298721/sky-sports-beginners-guide-to-gaelic-games
hurling,1855," The pitch : a large rectangular field.

2. The stick : called a hurley or hurl, a curved piece of ash.

3. The ball : called a 'sliotar', small and firm, about the size of a medium orange; a leather cover over a fibre-wrapped core.

4. The score : comprises both points and goals, a goal being equal to three points. Scores are obtained by propelling the sliotar with stick, foot or palm, over (for a point) or under (for a goal) the cross-section of the H-shaped goal, and between the upright posts.

5. The team : 15 on each side
Up to three players may be replaced during the course of the game by replacements from the bench ; it is usual to name six possible replacements at the beginning.

6. Control : One referee, assisted by two linesman (touch judges) and four umpires, two at each goal, control the flag. The umpires' function is to signal scores or wides.

7. The play : the referee starts the match by throwing the ball between the four players at the centre. The ball may be struck, kicked, caught (in one hand only), or delivered with a smack of the open hand; it may NOT be thrown. This flexibility gives the game a speed and excitement that is noticeably absent from a ground-only game such as hockey. A good deal of physical contact is tolerated, but deliberately striking another player with the stick is always an offence. A goal-keeper has some protection as long as he stays within his goal area, but if he leaves this he is no more favoured than any other player. A very distinctive feature of the game is called 'soloing', where a player balances the sliotar on the wide part ('bas') of the hurley, and runs with it balanced on the stick for an unrestricted distance as opposition players try to dispossess him. Play lasts for either 60 or 70 minutes depending on the status of the match, with the referee also acting as timekeeper. After a score or wide, play is re-started by a player, usually the goalkeeper, 'pucking out' : driving the ball from the hand into the centre of the pitch. When the ball escapes over the sideline it is driven back into play off the ground; this is known as a sideline 'cut'. The linesman's function is to place the sliotar for this, and to nominate which team is to take it, the side that last touched the ball in play surrendering the cut to the other.",https://irelandmidwest.com/Hurlingrules.htm
shinty,1893,"Two teams (usually of six or twelve players a side) play on a field of similar proportions and size to a soccer pitch. The players use Camans (hooked/curved sticks with a triangular cross section) to strike the shinty ball, either in the air or on the ground, with the intention of scoring a goal. As in soccer, a goalkeeper guards the goal nets, which measure 12 feet across and 10 feet high. A shinty match is either 30 minutes (for six-a-side) or 90 minutes (for twelve-a-side) in length, divided into two halves with a short break between. A referee regulates play, enforcing rules and calling fouls for illegal and/or dangerous play. There are also side judges and goal judges to assist in calling side-outs, end-outs and goals. A more detailed explanation of the rules can be found elsewhere on the US Camanachd site (here) and a full set of rules and regulations, as well as rules for shinty/hurling hybrid matches, can be found at the Camanachd Association site here.","https://universitytimes.ie/2011/01/a-rough-guide-to-shinty-in-trinity/#:~:text=Shinty%20players%20usually%20are%20not,crossbar%20are%20worth%201%20point."
korfball,1902,"The ball (football sized), must be passed from hand to hand. To score a goal, the ball must pass through the Korf (Dutch for “basket” – similar in design to a wastepaper basket with no base). These are suspended three and a half metres off the floor (much higher than you can jump – no slam dunks!), and situated in the centre of the two halves of the pitch. This means play can move around the posts, allowing much more movement and fluidity.

One of the most original rules of the sport is the Defending law. This effectively states that an attacker cannot shoot if their defender is within arm’s length of them. To shoot in this circumstance is a foul, punished by the ball being passed to the defenders. The ramifications of this rule are tremendous. It immediately creates a game where the aim is to create space for yourself and your team.mates. It also removes most of a height disadvantage, as you can still stop your attacker from shooting without having to physically block the ball.

Running with the ball is not allowed, but there is a certain amount of flexibility. If you catch the ball while moving, you are allowed a couple of steps to either bring yourself to a stop or to release the ball. This creates the possibility to use a “running-in shot” (similar to a lay-up in basketball). This complicates the defender’s job, as they must try to stay close to their attacker (within arm’s length to stop any long shots), but not so close that their attacker can run round them and score with a running in shot.

League games are generally twenty-five minutes each half but tournament games can range from 15minutes up to an hour. While the ball is at your end you can get as much exercise as you can handle, then you get a rest as the ball moves to the other half.",https://lukorf.wordpress.com/korfball-explained/

basque pelota,1929,"The ball however, is not soft like a tennis ball as one would imagine, since it is after all, hit with an open hand. Instead, the ball, or pelota as it’s called locally, is made from box wood that is covered by layers of latex and wool, and is topped off with a coat of leather. For this reason, it is very important for the players to protect their hands properly for the game.

The players, or pelotaris as they are called in Basque, cut small strips of various types of adhesives that are formed into particular shapes according to where they are positioned on the hand.

In the end, they are able to create many small pads which cover the inside of their hands. These pads are referred to as “tacos.” (not to be confused with the mexican variety... totally different type of taco).

Even with the tacos covering their hands, injuries can and do happen. Pelotaris are known for having some hardcore hands.
Pelota mano can be played one on one or in couples. The rules of the game are very simple. The main rule is that the ball must hit the front wall and then the other player must return the ball while it’s in the air or off the first bounce. Another important rule concerns the serve.

After the ball hits the front wall, the ball must land between two designated lines called the “falta” and the “pasa” in order to be valid. With only this amount of basic knowledge of these few rules, you should be ready to check out a game and understand what is going on.","https://www.euskoguide.com/basque-sports/pelota-mano/#:~:text=Pelota%20mano%20can%20be%20played,or%20off%20the%20first%20bounce."
jeu de paume,1599,"The game is begun by a service which is always from the same end of the court (the service side). The opposite end of the court where the receiver stands is called the hazard side. The service does not alternate with each game as in lawn tennis. The server changes ends and ceases to serve only when a chase has been laid. The meaning of a chase will be explained below. To be a valid service the ball has to touch the penthouse roof at least once on the hazard side of the net and drop in the service court. If it does not touch the penthouse roof or if it hits a window or the roof it will be a fault. A second serve is available, as in lawn tennis.

A chase is laid on the floor where the ball bounces for the second time, other than in the winning area on the hazard size, without being hit by the player. On the service side a chase is laid wherever the ball bounces for a second time. On the hazard side a hazard chase is laid if the ball bounces the second time between the net and the line parallel to it furthest from the net. If it lands a second time between that line and the back wall, it is a point for the server.

The galleries on either side of the net also count as chases with the exception on the hazard side of the winning gallery. If the ball enters the winning gallery after crossing the net, either without touching the floor or after one bounce, it is a point for the server. Other winning openings which provide outright winners are the dedans on the service side and the grille on the hazard side.

If a chase is laid, the point is not won by that shot, and instead the point is kept in abeyance until the player changes ends. When the players change end, the receiver (who was previously the server) has to beat the chase. The players change ends if two chases have been laid or if one player reaches game point and there is one chase. If it is a hazard chase, the receiver will beat the chase by playing any shot which the server cannot return, either on the floor or by hitting one of the galleries on the service side. If it is a service chase, the receiver will beat the chase by the second bounce landing nearer the back wall than where the chase was laid. To assist in determining where precisely a ball bounces the second time, lines are marked on the floor at intervals of one yard. The figures above the lines on the opposite wall show the number of yards measured, on the service side, from the back wall and, on the hazard side, from the service line. The nearer a chase on the service side is to the back wall, the more difficult it is to beat.

When the players change ends, the first point to be played is the chase. The marker will call out the chase which the receiver hopes to beat. If the chase is exactly on a yard line, the marker will call out the number of yards, eg ""chase 2 and 3"" means two and a half yards from the back wall. If the chase falls between a yard and a half-yard line, the marker will call out ""better than"" or ""worse than"" the yard line, depending on whether the ball fell nearer the back wall, or further from the back wall, than the yard line. If the ball went into a gallery, the marker calls out the name of that gallery, eg the Last Gallery. Each gallery has a line on the floor opposite to the centre of the gallery. If the chase is laid on the floor between galleries, the marker calls out ""better / worse than"" say, the Second Gallery.",https://balls.com/rules/jeu-de-paume-game-of-the-palm.html
caber toss,1848,"In the caber toss, a full-length log, usually made of Scots pine, is stood upright and lifted by the competitor using both hands under the bottom of the caber to rest against their body.

The competitor then runs forward, building momentum, before tossing the caber into the air so that it turns end over end with the upper end landing before the end originally held by the competitor follows through and hits the ground. The aim is for the caber to land in line with the original run. If it is straight the toss is said to be in the 12 o'clock position. Competitors are judged on how closely their toss lands to 12 o'clock.",https://www.ncpedia.org/media/caber-toss
petanque,1907,"At the very start of the game, for the first round (“la premiere mène”), we randomly draw which team goes first.

1. The starting team draws a small circle on the floor. (There are also small prefabricated plastic or metal circles that can be bought and used. But usually, tracing a circle with your foot or a stick in the dusty ground works just fine!)
Every player will then have to throw their boules from the circle during that round (in other words, this will be the starting point for all players).

2. The first player throws le cochonnet, which must land anywhere between 6 meters and 10 meters from the starting circle (otherwise it’s too easy / too hard and you need to throw the cochonnet again.)

3. A player from the opposing team throws their first boule, as close to the cochonnet as possible (since that is how you win the game!)

Remember the rule for throwing your boules when playing pétanque:

Both feet need to be within the circle and on the ground. (Therefore, there is no running before throwing the boule!)

5. The team who does not have the point throws the next boule and continues to do so until they gain the point or run out of boules.

The players within one team can play in any order, depending on whether they require the skills of one of their “pointeurs” or “tireurs”!

Pointer = to point (to throw the boule so that it gets as close to the jack as possible)
Un pointeur = a pétanque players whose task is to point / to aim at the jack.
Tirer = to knock away an opponent’s boule – a good way to get rid of the boules of the opposing team that are close to the cochonnet! By the way, if the cochonnet is moved/knocked away by a ball, the game still goes on (but it’s not very ethical to do so deliberately!)
Un tireur = a pétanque player who is skilled at knocking away the opponent’s boules (that is, not me!)
6. At the end of an end, the team with the boule closest to the cochonnet scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team’s closest boule.

bocce,1753,"Bocce is played with eight large balls and one smaller target or object ball called a pallina. There are four balls per team and they are made of a different color or pattern to distinguish the balls of one team from those of the other team.

The game is played with two teams, with each team having one, two, or four players. For four player teams, each player throws one ball. For two player teams, each player throws two balls. For one player teams, each player throws four balls. When there are multiple players on a team, a playing rotation is determined at the start of a game and is maintained throughout the entire game.

A game begins with the toss of a coin. The team that wins the coin toss can choose to either have first toss of the pallina or the color of the balls they will use. To start a game, the pallina is rolled or tossed by a member of the team having won the coin toss. A player can toss the pallina any distance as long as it passes the center line of the court and stays within the boundaries of the court. If the player fails to toss the ball properly into play, a member of the opposing team will toss the ball into play. If the opposing team fails to properly toss the pallina into play, the toss reverts to a member of the original team.

The player tossing the pallina must deliver the first ball. If the ball lands outside of the boundaries of the court, that team must roll again until the first ball is put into play. Otherwise, that player steps aside and the opposing team will then deliver their balls until one of its Bocce balls is closer to the pallina or has thrown all its balls. The ""nearest ball"" rule governs the sequence of thrown balls. The side whose ball is closest to the pallina is called the ""in"" ball and the opposing side the ""out"" ball. Whenever a team gets ""in"", it steps aside and allows the ""out"" team to deliver. The other team throws until it gets its ball closer (not ties) to the pallina. This continues until both teams have thrown all their Bocce balls. After both teams have exhausted all their balls, a frame is over and points are awarded. The game resumes by teams throwing from the opposite end of the court. The team that was awarded points in the previous frame begins the next frame by tossing the pallina into play. 

All balls must be thrown underhanded. A team has the option of rolling, tossing, bouncing, etc. its ball down the court provided it does not go outside the boundaries of the court or the player does not violate the foul line. The foul line is used to deliver all balls down the court with the intent of getting a ball closer to the pallina, knocking the opponent's ball away from the pallina, or hitting the pallina so that it ends up closer to your team's ball. 

A player should not step on or over the foul line before releasing any ball. If a player steps over the foul line, the player will receive one warning. For a player that commits a second foul line infraction, the team fouled against will be awarded points as they were immediately proceeding the foul and the frame will end. The team committing the foul will be awarded no points for the frame. Or, the fouled against team may have the option of declining the penalty and completing the frame.

Any ball that goes outside the boundaries of the court is considered a dead ball and is removed immediately from play until the end of a frame. If the pallina is knocked outside the boundaries of the court during play, the frame ends with no points awarded and a new frame is started.

At the end of each frame, points will be awarded. Only one team scores in a frame. One point is awarded for each ball that is closer to the pallina than the closest ball of the opposing team. In the event that the closest ball of each team is the same distance from the pallina, no points will be awarded and the pallina returns to the team that delivered it. Only balls which are distinguishably closer to the pallina than any of the opponent's balls are awarded points. All measurements should be made from the center of the pallina to the edge of a Bocce ball. Games are played to 16 points with the first team reaching 16 points being the winner of a game.","https://www.backyardbocce.com/basic-rules/#:~:text=Only%20balls%20which%20are%20distinguishably,the%20winner%20of%20a%20game."
curling,1541,"Teams of four take it in turns to curl two rocks towards the target area with the scores being counted after all 16 rocks have been sent down the ice.
International matches have a time limit of 73 minutes per side with two timeouts lasting a minute each. 10 minutes and one timeout are permitted per extra end in the event of a tie.
The stone must be released its front edge crosses a line called the hog. Foul throws are removed from the ice before they have come to rest or in contact with other rocks.
Sweeping may be done by two members of the team up to the tee line, whilst after that point only one player can brush. After the tee one player from the opposing side may also sweep
A stone touched or moved when in play by a player or their broom will either be replaced or removed depending on the situation.

bandy,1882,"Bandy - Bandy Ball is played on ice, using a single round ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal. The game is designed to be played on a rectangle of ice-field which is the same size as a football (soccer) field. Bandy also has other rules that are similar to soccer: each team has 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The offside rule is also deployed. A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike soccer, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke. And all free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to this rule, however. 
In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as ""golden goal"" which means that the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.

The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball will result in a five-minute penalty.


In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as bydribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.",https://hockeygods.com/hockeys/15-bandy
archery,1931,"Equipment: Archers use a bow and arrows to shoot at a target. The bows can be recurve, compound, or longbows, and the arrows must be made of specific materials and meet certain length and weight requirements.
Target: The target is generally a circular board made of straw or foam with colored rings on it. The target is typically 122 cm in diameter and is placed at a distance of 18 meters for indoor competitions and 70 meters for outdoor competitions.
Scoring: The scoring is based on where the arrow lands on the target. The center of the target, called the bullseye, is worth the most points, with the outer rings worth progressively fewer points.
Rounds: Archery competitions are made up of several rounds. Each round consists of a set number of arrows shot at a specific target. The number of rounds and arrows can vary depending on the competition.",www.rulesofsport.com
afl,1859,"Each team has 18 players on the field, with four interchange players who can substitute for players on the field. Players wear a uniform consisting of a jumper, shorts, and boots with studs. The oval ball is made of leather and is slightly larger than a soccer ball.
Starting the Game: The game starts with a center bounce in the center square, where a neutral umpire throws the ball up into the air. The teams then compete to gain possession of the ball and move it towards their attacking goal.
Ball Movement: Players can move the ball by kicking, handballing (punching the ball with a closed fist), or running with the ball. The ball must be bounced every 15 metres if a player runs with it.
Scoring: Points are scored when the ball passes through the two large goal posts or the smaller behind posts located at either end of the oval. A goal, worth six points, is scored when the ball is kicked between the two large posts without otherwise being touched. If the ball passes between the two large posts but is not kicked, a behind worth one point is scored. A behind is also scored when the ball passes between the large and small posts.
Tackling: Players can tackle an opponent who has possession of the ball to try and win possession for their team. A successful tackle involves wrapping both arms around the opponent and bringing them to the ground. High tackles or tackles that involve contact to the head are penalized.
Marking: If a player catches the ball from a kick that has traveled at least 15 metres, without the ball touching the ground or being touched by another player, it is called a mark. The player who takes the mark is then awarded a free kick and cannot be tackled",www.rulesofsport.com
badminton,1877,"The winner of the toss can elect to serve or receive in the first game, or to choose to play at a particular end of the court. The loser of the toss makes the remaining choice.

Basic Aim
You win a rally if you hit the shuttle over the net and onto the floor of the opposing side's court.

You lose the rally if you hit the shuttle into the net, or over the net but outside of the opposing side's court. You also lose the rally if, for example, the shuttle touches you or your clothing, or if you hit it before it crosses the net.

Serving
The service courts are slightly different for singles and doubles. A shuttle on the line is ""in"". The server and receiver stand in the diagonally opposite service courts (always right hand at the start of the game) but after the serve players may move anywhere on their side of the net. The server must obey laws designed to force underhand delivery of the serve, and the receiver must stand still until the service is struck.
Matches comprise of the best of three games. Each game starts at 0-0 (called ""love-all""). If the serving side wins a rally, it scores a point, and serves again but from the alternate service court. If the receiving side wins the rally, the score remains unchanged and the service passes to the next player in turn. In singles, this is the opponent: in double it's either the partner or, if both players have just had a turn of serving, one of the opponents.

In men's singles and doubles events, 15 points wins a game. However, if the score reaches 14-14, the side which first reached 14 can choose either to play to 15, or to set the game to 17 points. The final score will reflect the sum of the points won before setting plus the points gained in setting.

Scoring in women's singles is slightly different - 11 points wins a game and there is the option to set to 13 points at 10-10

baseball,1845,"Baseball is played on a diamond-shaped field, with a base at each corner. The field is divided into two main sections: the infield and the outfield. The infield contains the bases and is where most of the action takes place. The outfield is where the ball is hit and where the defensive players attempt to catch the ball.

Each baseball team consists of nine players, and each team takes turns playing offense and defense. The game begins with a player from the defensive team, known as the pitcher, throwing the ball to a player from the offensive team, known as the batter. The batter's objective is to hit the ball into play.

The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound, and throws the ball to the batter, who is standing at the home plate. The batter attempts to hit the ball to a part of the field where the fielders cannot reach it.

If the batter hits the ball into fair territory, he or she runs to first base. If the ball is caught by a fielder, the batter is out. If the ball is hit out of the playing field, it is a home run.

After hitting the ball, the batter then runs to first base, then on to second, third and home, or as many as he can reach before the fielder returns the ball. If the batter reaches all bases and back home, he scores a run. If the batter reaches a base, and cannot continue as the ball has been returned, he can safely stay at the base and continue his run when the next batter comes to bat.

A batter is out if the fielder touches first base with the ball before the batter reaches it, or if the fielder touches the batter with the ball between bases, or if the fielder catches the ball before it lands. The batter is also out if he swings and misses three times, which is called a strike out.

When three players are out, the team's innings is over, and the opposing team has a turn at batting. Each team plays nine innings. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.

catan,1995,"The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlements on the fictional island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island.[9] The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game.[10] Newer editions of the game began to depict a fixed layout in their manual and recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration, the hexes of which cannot be rearranged.

Players build by spending resources (wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.

There is also a robber token, initially placed on the desert; if a player rolls 7, the robber must be moved to another hex, which will no longer produce resources until the robber is moved again. That player may also steal a resource card from another player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new placement. In addition, when a 7 is rolled, all players with 8 or more resource cards must discard their choice of half of their cards, rounded down. For example, If a player has 9 resource cards, and a 7 is rolled, the player must get rid of 4 cards.

On the player's turn, the player may spend resource cards to build roads or settlements, upgrade settlements to cities (which replace existing settlements), or buy development cards. Players can trade resource cards with each other; players may also trade off-island (in effect, with the non-player bank) at a ratio of four-to-one resources for one of any other. By building settlements adjacent to ports, players may trade with the bank at three-to-one (three of any single resource type) or two-to-one (two of a specific resource) ratios, depending on the port.

The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest army (by playing the most knight cards), grant a player additional victory points.

Resource cards can also be spent to buy a development card. There are five different types of development cards, including cards worth one victory point; knight cards, which allow the player to move the robber as if they had rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); monopoly cards, which allow the player to steal all of any one resource from other players; road building cards, which allow the player to build two roads without paying extra resource cards; and year of plenty cards which allow the player to pick up two resource cards of their choice.


Three players in a game of Catan
Teuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land.[11] Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, Entdecker and Löwenherz. The game's first expansion, Catan: Seafarers, adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as ""New Shores"") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions.[6]

In 2020, the Board Game Analysis blog created a mathematical model to evaluate how balanced any particular board layout is, with scores ranging from 0 to 1 and lower scores being more balanced. According to that model, the beginner layout recommended in the game's manual has a balance score of 0.094. They also analyzed a board layout used in a 2016 tournament, which scored a 0.106. A sample of 100 million randomly generated board layouts formed an approximately normal distribution with the majority of boards' scores clustered around 0.25",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan

d&d,1974,"Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game.[24] Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting.[24] When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a ""party"" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole.[25][26] During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game.[7] This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics, and imagination.[27] A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a ""campaign"".[7][28][29]

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.[29][30] The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.[7][25] Encounters often take the form of battles with ""monsters"" – a generic term used in D&D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures.[29] In addition to jewels and gold coins, magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon.[31] Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest.[32] The game's extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions,[30] magic use,[33] combat,[30] and the effect of the environment on PCs[34] – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules[30] or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.[35]

The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual.[21]

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage.

Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.[a] The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).

The king moves exactly one square adjacent to it. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.
A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both.)
The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an ""L"" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.
Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing en passant.
The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.[10]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess
