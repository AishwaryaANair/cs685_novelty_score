Sepak Raga,"This game uses a woven rattan ball that players kick continuously without letting it touch the ground. Kids usually form a circle and take turns kicking the ball. It doesn’t just require speed—it takes teamwork and sharp reflexes!

In Indonesia, it’s known as sepak raga, in Malaysia the name remains similar, while in Thailand it evolved into takraw. Though it's now a recognized competitive sport, it was once a casual game played in backyards and open fields.",1401,https://seasia.co/2025/04/09/childhood-in-motion-10-traditional-games-from-southeast-asia-you-mightve-played
Congklak ,"You’ve probably played this game using a long wooden board with carved holes and small seeds or pebbles. In Indonesia, it’s called congklak or dakon, in Malaysia it’s still congkak, and in the Philippines, it’s known as sungka. Though it may look simple, it’s a game of strategy and fast counting.

Often played in the late afternoon while sitting cross-legged, the game is usually filled with chatter and laughter. It also has strong ties to coastal culture, as it was often played by children from fishing communities.",-7000,https://seasia.co/2025/04/09/childhood-in-motion-10-traditional-games-from-southeast-asia-you-mightve-played
Tumbang Preso,"An empty can, a pair of slippers, and one kid playing the guard—that's the simple recipe for Tumbang Preso! It closely resembles Sepak Tekong in Indonesia. Players must knock down the can with a slipper, then run before the guard catches them.

This game is more than just running around—it’s all about strategy and teamwork. Filipino children often consider it a must-play during school holidays.",1635,https://seasia.co/2025/04/09/childhood-in-motion-10-traditional-games-from-southeast-asia-you-mightve-played
Engklek,"Boxes are drawn on the ground, players toss a stone into one of them, then hop on one foot through the sequence while trying to keep their balance. Engklek has long been a go-to game for kids who love to show off agility and coordination.

Luksong Tinik,"Literally meaning “jumping over thorns,” this game involves two players forming “thorns” with their feet while others try to leap over them. As the game progresses, the height of the “thorns” increases. It’s thrilling—especially when someone fails and everyone bursts into laughter!

Luksong Tinik is not just a physical challenge—it’s also about courage and adrenaline. In Cambodia and Laos, similar jumping games are often showcased during cultural festivals as part of folk traditions.",1973,https://seasia.co/2025/04/09/childhood-in-motion-10-traditional-games-from-southeast-asia-you-mightve-played
Egrang,"Ever tried walking on tall bamboo sticks? In Indonesia, it's called Egrang, a game that tests your balance as you walk as high as possible! Similar versions exist in Laos and Vietnam, often showcased in cultural festivals.

Jianzi,"The shuttlecock (called a jianzi in the Chinese game, or 'Chinese hacky sack' and 'kinja' in English) typically has four feathers fixed into a rubber sole or a plastic disc. Some handmade jianzis make use of a washer or a coin with a hole in the centre.

During play, any part of the body except for the hands can be used to keep the shuttlecock from touching the ground. It is primarily balanced and propelled upwards using parts of the leg, especially the feet. Skilled players may employ an overhead kick.[3] In China, the sport usually has two playing forms:

Circle kick among 5-10 people
Duel kick between two kickers or two sides.
The circle kick uses upward kicks only when keeping the shuttlecock from touching the ground. The duel kick has become popular among younger Chinese players, and uses ""flat kick"" techniques like goal shooting techniques in football. The ""powerful flat kick"" techniques are applied in Chinese games as a major attacking kill.",-202,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianzi#:~:text=Jianzi%20,c%E1%BA%A7u%2C%20and%20it%20is%20the"
Xiangqi ,"Xiangqi is played on a board nine lines wide and ten lines long. As in the game Go (围棋; or Wéi qí 圍棋), the pieces are placed on the intersections, which are known as points. The vertical lines are known as files (Chinese: 路; pinyin: lù; lit. 'road'), and the horizontal lines are known as ranks (Chinese: 線/綫; pinyin: xiàn; lit. 'line').

Centred at the first to third and eighth to tenth ranks of the board are two zones, each three points by three points, demarcated by two diagonal lines connecting opposite corners and intersecting at the centre point. Each of these areas is known as 宮 gōngⓘ, a palace.

Dividing the two opposing sides, between the fifth and sixth ranks, is 河 hé, the ""river"". The river is usually marked with the phrases 楚河 chǔ héⓘ, meaning ""River of the Chu"", and 漢界 hàn jièⓘ, meaning ""Border of the Han"", a reference to the Chu–Han War. Although the river (or Hanchu boundary) provides a visual division between the two sides, only two pieces are affected by its presence: soldiers have an enhanced move after crossing the river, and elephants cannot cross it. The starting points of the soldiers and cannons are usually, but not always, marked with small crosses.

The pieces start in the position shown in the diagram above. Which player moves first has varied throughout history and from one part of China to another. Different xiangqi books advise either that the black or red side moves first.[citation needed] Some books refer to the two sides as north and south; which direction corresponds to which colour also varies from source to source. Generally, Red moves first in most modern tournaments.[1]

Each player in turn moves one piece from the point it occupies, to another point. Pieces are generally not permitted to move through points occupied by other pieces, the exception being the cannon’s capturing move. A piece can be moved onto a point occupied by an enemy piece, in which case the enemy piece is captured and removed from the board. A player cannot capture one of their own pieces. Pieces are never promoted (converted into other pieces), although the soldier gains the ability to move sideways after it crosses the river. Almost all pieces capture using their normal moves, while the cannon has a special capture move described below.


An instance of checkmate that assumes the cannon is safe and Black cannot block the check. The horse is not needed for this checkmate.
The game ends when one player checkmates the other's general. When the general is in danger of being captured by the enemy player on their next move, the enemy player has ""delivered a check"" (照將/將軍, abbreviated as 將 jiāngⓘ), and the general is ""in check"". A check should be announced. If the general's player can make no move to prevent the general's capture, the situation is called ""checkmate"" (將死). Unlike in chess, in which stalemate is a draw, in xiangqi, it is a loss for the stalemated player.

In xiangqi, a player—often with a material or positional disadvantage—may attempt to check or chase pieces in a way such that the moves fall in a cycle, preventing the opponent from winning. While this is accepted in Western chess, in xiangqi, the following special rules are used to make it harder to draw the game by endless checking or chasing, regardless of whether the positions of the pieces are repeated or not:

Perpetual checks with one piece or several pieces are not allowed; doing so results in a loss.
Perpetual chases of any one unprotected piece with one or more pieces, excluding generals and soldiers, are similarly prohibited.[2]
If one side perpetually checks and the other side perpetually chases, the checking side has to stop or be ruled to have lost.
When neither side violates the rules and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.
When both sides violate the same rule at the same time (note that unlike in western chess, a mutual perpetual check is possible) and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.
Mutual perpetual check

A mutual perpetual check occurs with (see #Notation below for notation) 1.Hd7+ Hf4+ 2.Ae2+ Hh3+ 3.Af3+ Hf4+ 4.Ae2+ etc.
Different sets of rules set different limits on what is considered perpetual. For example, club xiangqi rules allow a player to check or chase six consecutive times using one piece, twelve times using two pieces, and eighteen times using three pieces before considering the action perpetual.[2]

The above rules to prevent perpetual checking and chasing, while popular, are not the only ones; there are numerous end game situations.[3]",548,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi#:~:text=The%20game%20represents%20a%20battle,rather%20than%20within%20the%20squares"
Go,"Go is an adversarial game between two players with the objective of capturing territory. That is, occupying and surrounding a larger total empty area of the board with one's stones than the opponent.[21] As the game progresses, the players place stones on the board creating stone ""formations"" and enclosing spaces. Once placed, stones are never moved on the board, but when ""captured"" are removed from the board. Stones are linked together into a formation by being adjacent along the black lines, not on diagonals (of which there are none). Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion, reduction, or wholesale capture and loss of formations and their enclosed empty spaces (called ""eyes""). Another essential component of the game is control of the sente (that is, controlling the offense, so that one's opponent is forced into defensive moves); this usually changes several times during play.


The illustration [A] displays the four ""liberties"" (adjacent empty points) of a single black stone. Illustrations [B], [C], and [D] show White reducing those liberties progressively by one. In [D], when Black has only one liberty left, that stone is under attack and about to be captured and eliminated (a state called atari).[22] White may capture that stone (remove it from the board) with a play on its last liberty (at D-1).
Initially the board is bare, and players alternate turns to place one stone per turn. As the game proceeds, players try to link their stones together into ""living"" formations (meaning that they are permanently safe from capture), as well as threaten to capture their opponent's stones and formations. Stones have both offensive and defensive characteristics, depending on the situation.

An essential concept is that a formation of stones must have, or be capable of making, at least two enclosed open points known as eyes to preserve itself from being captured. A formation having at least two eyes cannot be captured, even after it is surrounded by the opponent on the outside,[23] because each eye constitutes a liberty that must be filled by the opponent as the final step in capture. A formation having two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally alive,[24] so it can evade capture indefinitely, and a group that cannot form two eyes is said to be dead and can be captured.

The general strategy is to place stones to fence-off territory, attack the opponent's weak groups (trying to kill them so they will be removed), and always stay mindful of the life status of one's own groups.[25][26] The liberties of groups are countable. Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races, or semeai.[27] In a capturing race, the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent's stones.[27][28][b] Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go.

In the end game players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play.[29] The game ends when both players pass[30] or when one player resigns. In general, to score the game, each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent. The player with the greater score (after adjusting for handicapping called komi) wins the game.

In the opening stages of the game, players typically establish groups of stones (or bases) near the corners and around the sides of the board, usually starting on the third or fourth line in from the board edge rather than at the very edge of the board. The edges and corners make it easier to develop groups which have better options for life (self-viability for a group of stones that prevents capture) and establish formations for potential territory.[31] Players usually start near the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board.[32] Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently.[33] However, in the mid-game, stone groups must also reach in towards the large central area of the board to capture more territory.

Dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white, and as such are considered to be of no value to either side. Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes.

Ko (Chinese and Japanese: 劫) is a potentially indefinitely repeated stone-capture position. The rules do not allow a board position to be repeated. Therefore, any move which would restore the previous board position would not be allowed, and the next player would be forced to play somewhere else. If the play requires a strategic response by the first player, further changing the board, then the second player could ""retake the ko,"" and the first player would be in the same situation of needing to change the board before trying to take the ko back. And so on.[34] Some of these ko fights may be important and decide the life of a large group, while others may be worth just one or two points. Some ko fights are referred to as picnic kos when only one side has a lot to lose.[35] In Japanese, it is called a hanami ko.[36]

Playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each player's strength, indicated by the player's rank (increasing from 30 kyu to 1 kyu, then 1 dan to 7 dan, then 1 dan pro to 9 dan pro). A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap—Black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for White's greater strength.[37][38] There are different rulesets (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, AGA, etc.), which are almost entirely equivalent, except for certain special-case positions and the method of scoring at the end.",-2852,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)#:~:text=Go%20is%20an%20adversarial%20game,%22formations%22%20and%20enclosing%20spaces."
Mahjong,"Each player in turn, in counter-clockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out the win (each region does this call differently—no Asian version uses the word ""mahjong"" to signal a win) while revealing their hand.

There are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:

A bonus tile (flower or season) is drawn
A meld (pung, kong, or chow) is made from a discard
Going mahjong (declaring a winning hand)
Robbing a kong
During play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any bonus tiles (flowers and seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.

Qianghuapao,"Firework-snatching, known in China as Qianghuapao, is a traditional sport of many ethnic groups including the Zhuang, Miao and Dong. The traditional way of playing is to launch a firework into the air and young men compete to get it. The arena could be any places, even ponds, cliffs, and so it is called a ""game of brave guys"". But the game has been improved into a new style, similar to American football, spanning 40 minutes in two 20-minute halves, with a ten minute break. The firework has been replaced by safer rubber disc with a diameter of 15 cm.",2015,https://www.traditionalsports.org/traditional-sports/asia/qianghuapao-china.html
Kendama,"The general concept of kendama is pulling the ken up and balancing the tama somewhere on the ken, or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama. However, bending the knees while playing kendama is a method that experts use.[4] Endless tricks and trick combinations can be made with just ken grip, sara grip, tama grip, and candle grip by themselves or together in a combination. Some examples of tricks in each of these grips are as follows:

Ken grip
Spike: This trick involves the hole in the tama and the spike.

Hold the ken with the spike pointing straight up
Hold the ball with the off hand to ensure the ball is still before starting the motion of this trick
Bend the knees
Pull the tama up with the entire body
Catch the ball in the spike by directing the spike underneath the hole in the tama[5]
Swing Spike: a variation of the Spike.

Hold the ken in a way similar to preparing a spike
Hold the ball with the opposite hand and slightly bring it back towards the body, keeping the tension in the string
Let go of the ball and swing the ball out in front of self
Tug the string a bit to make the ball rotate the hole 360° towards self
Catch the tama on the spike by connecting the spike and the hole together.[6]
Around Japan: This trick is a combination of the big cup, small cup, and the spike.

Pull the ball up into the small cup
Hop the ball over to the big cup by rotating the wrist to the right (and vice versa if left handed)
Keep an eye on the hole, and hop the ball up onto the spike, connecting the hole and spike together[7]
Note: The following combination is also ok: big cup→small cup→spike.",1501,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama
Shogi,"Each player's nine Pawns are placed on the third nearest row to the player. The Rook and the Bishop are placed on the second row one space in from the edge, the Rook on the right, the Bishop on the left. The remaining pieces are placed on the row nearest to the player in the following way: the Lances in each corner, the Knights on the next square in from the corner, the Silver Generals next to the Knights. The middle square on the nearest row holds the King with the Gold Generals either side of him.

The objective of Japanese Chess is to capture the opposing player's King. The King is never actually taken; instead the aim is put the opponent's King into a position such that the opposing player can do nothing to avoid the King being taken next turn. As soon as this happens, the victorious player who has just moved says ""checkmate"" and the game is over.

Basic Play for Shogi
Players take turns to move a piece that belongs to them. Each piece is moved according to different rules but no two pieces can occupy the same square. If a piece moves so that its final position is a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is ""captured"" or ""taken"" and is removed from the board. Captured pieces should be placed face up within easy view of both players. It is not compulsory to capture.


King - moves one space in any direction diagonally or orthogonally EXCEPT that the King cannot move onto a square that is attacked by an opposing piece.

Gold General - moves one space in one of 6 directions - forwards, diagonally forwards, sideways or backwards.

Silver General - moves one space in one of 5 directions - forwards, diagonally forwards or diagonally backwards.

Knight - moves two squares forwards and then one square sideways. Only two squares are available to the Knight but, in compensation, it is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.

Lance - moves any number of spaces forwards.

Rook - moves any number of spaces orthogonally but cannot jump over another piece.

Bishop - moves any number of spaces diagonally but cannot jump over another piece.

Pawn - moves one square forwards only.",794,https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/shogi-rules.htm?srsltid=AfmBOoqxdWtP8IQvMyb2l997ZGENzHCLOhnidKn7brnoxPcZk6eyfRdL
yutnori,"The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate by discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a yut or mo earns an extra cast for the turn; if the player casts a yut or mo at the second cast, they earn an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided they keep casting yuts or mos. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a geol (advance three steps) cannot be split into a do (one step) and a gae (two steps).


The four possible courses of the game of Yut
As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two yuts and one do at their first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see The Stations below for the station names):

Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut score); advance to mo (uses the do score), then to sok-yut (uses the second yut).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses first yut score); put another mal on the board at the same yut station (uses the second yut score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to mo (uses the do).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut); advance to duet-geol (uses the second yut), then to duet-yut (uses the do).
The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (cham-meoki). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going ""beyond"" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins",-57,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnori
ssireum,"Ssireum is conducted within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which is covered with mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (baro japki), each grabbing a belt—known as a satba (샅바)[10]—which is wrapped around his opponent's waist and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other's 'satba.' The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher. Unlike sumo, pushing an opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional ssireum is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.

There are three judges, a chief referee and three sub referees. The chief judge is positioned inside the ring, whereas the sub referees are located on the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a revocation of the decision or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees' decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.

Today there are also women ssireum wrestlers. Women wrestle only among themselves but follow the same rules (except that men are topless whereas women wear tops).

There are four weight classes in professional wrestling: flyweight (Taebaek, 75 kg), lightweight (Geumgang, 90 kg), middleweight (Halla, 105 kg), and heavyweight (Baekdu, under 160 kg), named after the four famous peaks in Korea.[11]

Traditionally ssireum was contested with the top portion of the trousers rolled down to provide grip. The use of ""satba"" was invented with the birth of professional ssireum in the mid-20th century. There is a movement to restore this traditional method of grip, in the spirit of maintaining its cultural and traditional roots, but it has met with some resistance as the use of ""satba"" has become entrenched in the modern form.

The professional league is dwindling in popularity and many wrestlers have turned their attention to mixed martial arts fighting, even though ssireum involves no striking or submissions of any kind, as a means of making a living. Choi Hong-man, former champion of ssireum, enjoyed notable success in the K-1 scene. Unfortunately, the future of professional ssireum remains bleak, with only one team remaining. However, it can also be argued that ssireum is beginning to undergo global expansion as a popular martial arts sport, alongside taekwondo and hapkido.

It is important to note the differences between ssireum and sumo. Ssireum has remained largely a national/traditional sport. Physical hits such as slaps and blows are not permitted in ssireum, though they are in sumo. In both sports, the competitors are often quite large, though Korean wrestlers tend to be leaner. However, size does not guarantee success in either sport. Although both sports are quite similar, they differ in characteristics as well as values.

The national governing body of the sport in Korea, Korean Ssireum Organisation, has made a claim that ssireum is characterised as a ""peaceful competition focusing on harmony and unison"", reflecting the ""philosophical outlook of the Koreans""",-37,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssireum

Naadam’s Three Sports - wrestling,"A total of 512 or 1024 wrestlers meet in a single-elimination tournament that lasts nine or ten rounds. Mongolian traditional wrestling is an untimed competition in which wrestlers lose if they touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. When picking pairs, the wrestler with the greatest fame has the privilege to choose his opponent. Wrestlers wear two-piece costumes consisting of a tight shoulder vest (zodog) and shorts (shuudag). Only men are allowed to participate.

Each wrestler has an ""encourager"" called a zasuul. The zasuul sings a song of praise for the winning wrestler after rounds 3, 5, and 7. Winners of the 7th or 8th stage (depending on whether the competition features 512 or 1024 wrestlers) earn the title of zaan, ""elephant"". The winner of the 9th or 10th stage is called arslan, ""lion"".[11] In the final competition, all the ""zasuuls"" drop in the wake of each wrestler as they take steps toward each other.

horse racing,"Unlike Western horse racing, which consists of short sprints generally not much longer than 2 km, Mongolian horse racing as featured in Naadam is a cross-country event, with races 15–30 km long. The length of each race is determined by age class. For example, two-year-old horses race for 16 km (10 mi) and seven-year-olds for 27 km (17 mi). Up to 1000 horses from any part of Mongolia can be chosen to participate. Race horses are fed a special diet.

Children from 5 to 13 are chosen as jockeys and train in the months preceding the races. While jockeys are an important component, the main purpose of the races is to test the skill of the horses.[12]

Before the races begin, the audience sings traditional songs and the jockeys sing a song called Gingo. Prizes are awarded to horses and jockeys. The top five horses in each class earn the title of airgiyn tav and the top three are given gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winning jockey is praised with the title of tumny ekh or leader of ten thousand. The horse that finishes last in the Daaga race (two-year-old horses race) is called bayan khodood (meaning ""full stomach"").

All the archers wear leather bracers up to the elbow on their outstretched arm, so that the deel's cuff does not interfere with shooting.

Mongolian archery is unique for having dozens of surs as targets. Each sur is a small woven or wooden cylinder. They are placed on top of each other forming a wall three-high, which is approximately 8 inches high by 5 feet wide. Knocking a sur out of the wall with an arrow counts as a hit, though knocking a sur out of the centre will bring a competitor more points. When the archer hits the target, the judge says uuhai which means ""hooray"". After each hit, an official repairs the damaged wall and makes it ready for the next attempt. The winners of the contest are granted the titles of ""national marksman"" and ""national markswoman",-20000,https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/8294

chinese checkers,"A toss of a coin decides who starts. Players take turns to move a single peg of their own colour. In one turn a peg may either be simply moved into an adjacent hole OR it may make one or more hops over other pegs.

Where a hopping move is made, each hop must be over an adjacent peg and into a the vacant hole directly beyond it. Each hop may be over any coloured peg including the player's own and can proceed in any one of the six directions. After each hop, the player may either finish or, if possible and desired, continue by hopping over another peg. Occasionally, a player will be able to move a peg all the way from the starting triangle across the board and into the opposite triangle in one turn!

Pegs are never removed from the board. However, once a peg has reached the opposite triangle, it may not be moved out of the triangle - only within the triangle.

The question soon arises as to whether it is possible to move a peg into a triangle that is the starting or target triangle for another player. House rules apply but Masters Games suggests the following: A peg can be hopped through such a triangle but is not allowed to come to rest in that triangle.",1892,https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/chinese-checkers-rules.htm?srsltid=AfmBOoqQwYCZdUZp1RvoRjz7AOcciUzAZDzbY-SCtLpTcJmllRdmlpaj

King — “Khun” — Lord

Queen — “Met” — Seed
Moves only one space diagonally. This is the move of the piece in the queen’s place, found in most ancient forms of chess.	move of the queen 'met' or seed in makruk (Thai chess)
Bishop — “Khon” — Nobleman
Moves one space diagonally or one space forward. This move is found in Japanese chess, and in other chess variants of Southeast Asia.	move of the bishop 'khon' or nobleman in makruk (Thai chess)
Knight — “Ma” — Horse
Moves two spaces forward, backward, right or left, plus one space at a right angle. This is the only piece allowed to jump over any intervening piece in its path. It has exactly the same move as the knight in western chess.	move of the knight 'ma' or horse in makruk (Thai chess)
Rook — “Rua” — Boat
Moves as many spaces as desired forward, backward, right or left. Can not leap over any pieces. This move is exactly the same as that of the western rook.	move of the rook 'rua' or boat in makruk (Thai chess)
Pawn — “Bia” — Cowry Shell
When moving normally, this piece moves one step forward; but it captures by moving one step forward-diagonally. Exactly like the western pawn, but with no power to move two spaces on its first move.	move of the pawn 'bia' or cowry shell in makruk (Thai chess)

Promoted Pawn — “Biagai” — (Promoted Cowry)

When the pawn reaches the 6th row (i.e., the opponent’s 3rd row), it is flipped over and its move is changed to the move of the queen (met): one space in any diagonal direction.	move of the promoted pawn 'biagai'  in makruk (Thai chess)
a sample line-up of Thai chessmen

Did you notice that the king, queen and bishop are essentially the same shape, but different in size? Even the rook is similar, but a more squat figure. It may be confusing at first, but you will get used to distinguishing them.

Captures

All pieces capture by moving onto the square of an enemy piece and removing that piece from the board. Only the pawn has a special move for capturing; all others use their normal moves to capture.

Check and Checkmate

When a player’s king is threatened with capture (in check), he must move in such a way that the king is no longer threatened. If he can not, he is in checkmate, and the game is lost. If, however, the player finds that any move he makes will put his king in check, but he in not in check at the moment, this is a stalemate, and the game is a draw.

Drawn Games

Many games of makruk end in draws, and this is because of special rules in the endgame which permit the disadvantaged player to claim a draw in very peculiar, and sometimes rather complex, ways. The back panel of this brochure explains the special drawn game rules.

Special Drawn Game Rules

When you find yourself with a less powerful group of pieces than your opponent, there are two special rules which may draw the game:

I. The Board’s Honor Rule

If there are no unpromoted pawns on the board, and you are at a distinct disadvantage, you may begin counting your moves aloud up to 64 (the number of squares on the board). If you are able to make the 65th move and you haven’t been checkmated, the game is a draw.

II. The Pieces’ Honor Rule

Watch for the situation in which (1) you have a lone king with no remaining pieces and, at the same time (2) there are no unpromoted pawns on the board. At that moment (when your last piece is taken, or your opponent’s last pawn is promoted), you must stop and do some figuring. Follow this system carefully, and you may be able to claim a draw.

1. Find the move count number in this way. First ask,
(1) Does the opponent have 2 rooks? If so, the number is 8.
If not, go to the next question:
(2) Does he have 1 rook? If so the number is 16.
Continue to ask, in this order, until you get an affirmative answer:
(3) 2 bishops? If so, it’s 22; (4) 2 knights? If so, it’s 32;
(5) 1 bishop? If so, it’s 44; (6) any pieces at all? If so, it’s 64.

2. Now that you have the move count number, count all of the pieces on the board, including all of your opponents pieces, his king and your king. For instance if he has 1 rook, 2 bishops, 2 promoted pawns and a king, against your lone king, you count up to 7. (In this example the move count number is 16.)

3. Now, as you make your move (finally, after all that calculating), begin counting from where you left off. In the example above, your move will be counted “8.” You continue to count all of your own moves (in this example, ...9, 10, 11…) up to the move count number (in this example ...16). If you reach the move count number without being checkmated, your opponent has one final move to deliver checkmate. If he can not — congratulations — you’ve drawn the game!

Ô Ăn Quan,"The board is an oval with five squares per side and, in addition, a bigger one at each end. The small squares are called ""citizen squares"" (ô dân), ""ricefields"" (ruộng) or ""fishponds"" (ao ci) and the big ones ""mandarin squares"" (ô quan). The board is drawn on the ground.

Each player or team controls five farmer squares, while the mandarin squares are neutral.

Each player puts five pebbles (fruit seeds or other small objects) in each square he owns and a big stone, the ""mandarin"" (quan), on the mandarin square. The pebbles are known as dân (""people"", ""citizen"").

Initial Position

The first player is determined by oẳn tù tì (""one, two, three""), which is a Vietnamese variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

On his turn a player picks up the contents of one of his ricefields and distributes the pebbles, one by one, in either direction on the following squares (including both mandarin squares). This is called rải (""to scatter"").

He lifts the contents of the square immediately behind the last one where a pebble was dropped and keeps on distributing its contents.

However, if a mandarin square follows, the turn ends.
The move ends when the last pebble falls on a square, which is followed by an empty one.

If there are two or more empty squares, the turn passes.
If the empty square is followed by a non-empty one, he captures its contents, and if it is followed by another empty square and another non-empty one, he captures the contents of this one too, and so on. The captures are removed from the board.
A square, which contains many pieces, is called nhà giàu (""rich square""). Pebbles, which are on the Mandarin square, are known as quan non (""quan"": Mandarin; non: ""young"" / ""unripe"").

If all the ricefields of one player are empty at any time, he must put one pebble on each ricefield. These pebbles are taken from the captures. This is called ""to release the fish"" (thả cá). If on his/her side of the board are empty, he/she must use five won-pieces to place one piece down one square on his/her side and repeats the distribution. If a player doesn't have enough pebbles to fill every square, he must borrow them from the other player. At the end of the game, he must return them to his opponent.

The game ends when the two mandarin squares are empty, which is called ""fall of the mandarins"" (hết quan).

Then the remaining pieces belong to the player who owns their squares, which is expressed by the Vietnamese saying: ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, bán ruộng"" (literally: ""Mandarin doesn't exit, people disappear, getting the army out, selling the rice field."") or ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, kéo về"" (literally: ""Mandarin doesn't exit, people disappear, getting the army out, coming back."").

The winner is the player who has more points. Pebbles count 1 point, mandarins 10 points.

Match Rules
Before the next game starts, the loser asks the winner to give him as many pebbles he needs to reach the number of 35. Then the players put their pebbles in their old place and the game is played again under the same conditions as previously.

If the loser asks his companion for five pebbles for example, he owes to him provisionally one square of his series. This is called ""to give provisionally a ricefield"" (cầm ruộng). At the end of the game, the pebbles that the square thus given up contains will be divided equally among the two players.

If the loser asks his opponent for ten pebbles, he must give him one of his squares definitively, which is called bán ruộng (""to sell a ricefield""). If he has lost by 20 pebbles, he must even sell two ricefields. The pebbles that remain in the sold ricefields at the end of the game are won by the new owner of the square.

In the next round it is possible to get back the sold ricefield, if the player wins by (at least) 10 pebbles.

The game continues until three or four squares of the same series are sold. The player of this series holds out his hands to the winner who beats them",1986,https://mancala.fandom.com/wiki/%C3%94_%C4%82n_Quan
Congklak,"The congkak board consists of two rows of 7 holes called the 'houses' and two   bigger holes called the 'storehouse'.

2.                Before the game starts the 'houses' are filled with seven congkak seeds each while the 'storehouses' are left empty.

3.               Both players begin simultaneously by scooping up all the shells in any house on their side. Each drops a shell into the next 'house' and continues clockwise depositing one shell into every house thereafter. A player drops a shell into his 'storehouse' each time he passes it but does not deposit any into his opponent's 'storehouse'.

4.               How the game continues, depends on where the last shell of each scoop is deposited : 

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO THE PLAYER'S OWN 'STOREHOUSE': The player scoops up the shells from any of his 'houses' and distributes them in the cups ('houses') round the board but not in his opponents's 'storehouse'.

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO A 'HOUSE' (on either side of the board) CONTAINING SHELLS: The player scoops up all the shells in that 'house' and continues distributing them as described above.

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO THE PLAYER'S 'HOUSE' WHICH IS WITHOUT SHELLS: The player is entitled to collect the shells in his opponent's 'house' directly opposite his own. These shells collected from his opponent's house together with his last shell are deposited in his own 'storehouse'. If the opponent's 'house' opposite his own is empty, he deposits only his last shell in his own 'storehouse'. He forfeits his turn and stops playing. It is the opponent's turn now to distribute the shells.

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO AN EMPTY 'HOUSE' BELONGING TO THE OPPONENT: The player forfeits his turn and stops playing. He also forfeits his shell and leaves it in the opponent's 'house'. It is the opponent's turn now to distribute the shells.

5.                The first round ends when a player has no more shells on his side.

6.               Play resumes in the second round with players redistributing shells from their own 'storehouse' to their own 'houses'. Beginning from left to right, seven shells are placed in each 'house'. If a player does not have sufficient shells to fill his own 'houses', the remaining cups are left empty and are considered 'burnt'. The leftover shells are deposited into his own 'storehouse.' The opponent deposits excess shells he has won into his own 'storehouse'.

7.               The loser gets to start the second round. Play is continued as before but players will bypass 'burnt houses' for instance no shells are to be dropped into these houses. If a shell is accidentally dropped into a 'burnt house', it is confiscated and stored in the opponent's 'storehouse'.

When the ball drops to the ground it is dead, and the play starts again.

Chinlone means “basket-rounded or rounded basket ” in Burmese. The ball is woven from rattan, and makes a distinctive clicking sound when kicked that is part of the aesthetic of the game. Players use six points of contact with the ball: the top of the toes, the inner and outer sides of the foot, the sole, the heel, and the knee. The game is played barefoot or in chinlone shoes that allow the players to feel the ball and the ground as directly as possible. The typical playing circle is 6.7 metres (22 ft) in diameter. The ideal playing surface is dry, hard packed dirt, but almost any flat surface will do.

Burma is a predominantly Buddhist country, and chinlone games are a featured part of the many Buddhist festivals that take place during the year. The largest of these festivals goes on for more than a month with up to a thousand teams. An announcer calls out the names of the moves and entertains the audience with clever wordplay. Live music from a traditional orchestra inspires the players and shapes the style and rhythm of their play. The players play in time to the music and the musicians accent the kicks.

Both men and women play chinlone, often on the same team. Adults and children can play on the same team, and it is not unusual to see elders in their 80s playing.

In addition to the team style of chinlone, which is called “wein kat” or circle kick, there is also a solo performance style called ""tapandaing"". This solo style is only performed by women.

To play chinlone well, the whole team must be absolutely in the moment – their minds cannot wander or the ball will drop. All serious players experience an intensely focused state of mind, similar to that achieved in Zen meditation, which they refer to as jhana.

Chinlone is one of a family of football games played throughout the world. It is related to similar games in Southeast Asia known as takraw in Thailand, sepak raga in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, sipa in the Philippines, kator in Laos and da cau in Vietnam. A competitive variation of the game played over a net, called sepak takraw was developed in Malaysia in the 1940s. The origins of chinlone may be related to the ancient Chinese game of cuju or tsu chu, which is acknowledged by FIFA as being the oldest form of soccer. A similar game is also played in Japan where it is known as kemari. Chinlone is also related to the family of sports played by kicking a shuttlecock, known as jianzi in China and jegichagi in Korea. And there is some evidence to suggest that a variation of these games traveled across the Bering Straits and influenced Native Americans, who also played a variety of games keeping a ball up with the feet. These games are thought to be the origin of footbag, also known as hacky sack.",500,https://oca.asia/sports/info/7/55/?discipline_id=161
fang qui,"an abstract strategy board game played traditionally in the northwestern regions of China, especially Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other areas with a high concentration of Chinese Muslims. The game is also played by Dungans, who have brought the game with them to Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

The game is played on a 7x8 grid, with pieces played on the points, much as in Go. Players take turns alternately placing stones until the board has been filled up, attempting to form 2x2 squares with their pieces. When the board has been filled up, players each remove one of their opponent's stones. The player then counts up the squares that he/she has formed and removes an equal number of the opponent's pieces, as long as those pieces are not part of a square. After the initial removal of pieces, players take turns moving pieces; pieces can move any distance along the grid up, down, left, or right. Every time a square is formed, the player can remove one of the opponent's pieces(again, as long as this piece is not part of a square). The player who removes all of the opponent's pieces first is the winner.",2002,"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42225/fangqi#:~:text=Square%20chess%20(%E6%96%B9%E6%A3%8B%20f%C4%81ngq%C3%AD,high%20concentration%20of%20Chinese%20Muslims."

Blind Man’s Buff ( bit mat bat de),"One participant volunteers to play the “goat” and another, the “goat catcher”. Other players form a circle around the players.

The goat and goat catcher are blindfolded with handkerchiefs. The game begins when the catcher yells, “Done!” The goat can move wherever he or she likes but must occasionally bleat. The catcher listens for the bleats and grapples to find the goat. In turn, the goat must move quietly to avoid being trapped. Since both players are blindfolded, the goat and goat catcher must use both their ears and wits to win.

The other players distract the goat and goat catcher to make them turn in the wrong direction. This creates hilarious moments and prolongs the game. A new round begins once the goat has been caught. Other players who want to join the game may ask to play the goat or goat catcher.",1600,https://www.vietravel.com/en/vietnam-country-people/blind-mans-buff-v2748.aspx
sumo,"Sumo bouts take place in a ring that is approximately 15 feet in diameter and is raised on a block of clay that is known as a dohyo approximately 2.5 feet above the ground.
Each Sumo bout must begin with an elaborate ceremonial ritual in which the wrestlers both perform certain actions and throw salt into the ring. Once the ritual is over, the two wrestlers face each other and wait for the referee to begin the action.
Both wrestlers are to crouch with fists on the floor until the referee signifies the start of the match.
Both fighters then engage with each other in an attempt to win the bout.
There are essentially three ways that Rikishi can attempt to win the match:
Pushing their opponent out of the ring
Grabbing their opponent’s belt and forcing them out of the ring
Forcing their opponent to the floor
A Rikishi is permitted to use any technique to try and win the match apart from:
hair pulling
punching
striking the ears
choking
attacking the groin area
As soon as one competitor has been forced out of the ring or to the floor, the match is over and the referee announces the winner as well as the technique (kimarite) that was used to win the fight.
Contestants can also lose a Sumo fight by using an illegal technique (known as kinjite) or if their belt become undone",300,https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/sumo-wrestling.html
