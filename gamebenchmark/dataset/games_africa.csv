Achi,"1. Achi is played by two players, with four pieces each. It uses the same board as three men's morris, and pieces are placed on the points at which the lines connect. 2. The board starts empty, each player holding his four pieces in hand. 3. At first, each player in turn puts one piece on the board, at any vacant point. 4. Once all pieces are on the board, a player instead moves one of his pieces along a marked line to an adjacent empty point. 5. If a piece placed or moved as in rules 3 or 4 forms a row of three along a marked line (called a mill), the player who placed it so wins the game.",R. C. Bell (mid-20th century publication); http://www.cyningstan.com/game/107/achi,1979,Ghana,
Choko,"1. At the start of the game, the board is empty. 2. The player holding the pebbles goes first, after which the player with the sticks takes his turn, play then alternating between them. 3. Each player on his first turn must place a piece on any vacant square of the board. 4. In subsequent turns, a player may opt to place another piece if he has any left in hand, or instead to move a piece already on the board. 5. If one player places a piece, his opponent must then do the same, after which, the choice between placement and movement returns as described in rule 4. 6. A piece moves one square horizontally or vertically, to an adjacent square, which must be empty. 7. There are no diagonal moves in this game. 8. An enemy piece is captured by jumping over it and landing on the square beyond, which must be vacant. 9. The captured piece is removed from the board and takes no further part in the game. 10. Having captured a piece, the player then selects a second enemy piece and removes it from the board. 11. As with movement, diagonal captures are not allowed. 12. This game does not have multiple leaps as some other games do. 13. The game is finished when a player has captured all enemy pieces, in which case he is declared the winner. 14. If both players are reduced to three pieces or less, the game is declared a draw.",Cyningstan; http://www.cyningstan.com/game/344/choko,1879,West Africa,Played on a 5x5 board. Players have 12 pieces each. Traditionally played in sand with pebbles and sticks.
Dara,"1. The board, a grid of 5 rows of 6 playing spaces (known henceforth as squares), starts empty. 2. The players have twelve pieces each, one side black and the other white. 3. The players take turns to place a piece on any empty square, one at a time, black going first. 4. During this placement phase, it is not permitted to form a row of three pieces of one colour on the board. Diagonal rows have no significance, and are therefore allowed. 5. Once the placement phase is over, players take it in turns (black first) to move a piece from one square to an adjacent square. 6. Diagonal moves are not allowed. 7. A player is not allowed to form a row of four of his pieces. 8. If, when moving, a player forms a row of three pieces (excepting diagonals), he can capture any one of his opponent's pieces and remove it from the board. 9. If two lines of three are formed at once, still only one enemy piece may be removed. 10. If a player is reduced to two pieces, he loses and his opponent wins the game. 11. It is common to play a match, worth 10 points. A win is usually worth 1 point, unless the winner has lost no pieces, in which case it is worth 2. Some accounts mention variations: Rows of three or more are permitted during placement, but they do not count as captures. A player is permitted to form a row of four pieces during movement, but this does not count as a capture. One cannot form a row of three simply by moving the end piece from a row of four.",Cyningstan; http://www.cyningstan.com/game/148/dara; R. C. Bell,1950,"North Africa (Dakarkari people of Nigeria, Tamacheq people of the Sahara)",Played on a 5x6 grid. Variations exist regarding forming rows of three/four during placement and movement.
"Dogs and Jackals (also The Palm Tree Game, Shields, Hounds and Jackals)","Rules based on Jack Botermans reconstruction: Played by two players on a board with 59 holes, 5 pegged pieces each. Four casting sticks determine moves (marked sides up = score, all blank = 5). 1. Board empty, pieces in hand. 2. Player chooses a side. 3. First throw random. 4. Player throws casting sticks. 5.

Fanorona,"1. Played on a board of lines intersecting at 45 points. Two players, 22 pieces each, set up as per diagram. 2. White starts, turns alternate. 3. Move one piece along a marked line to an adjacent empty point. Diagonal moves are not available from every square. 4. Capture by approach: If a piece moves directly towards an enemy line (running in the same direction) and becomes adjacent, the enemy pieces are captured and removed. 5. Capture by withdrawal: If a piece moves directly away from an adjacent enemy line (running in the same direction), the enemy pieces are captured and removed. 6. If a move qualifies for both approach and withdrawal capture, player chooses one. 7. If a capture is possible, it must be made (player chooses if multiple options). 8. First move of the game: only one capture allowed. Subsequent moves: if the moved piece can move and capture again, it must continue doing so as long as further captures are available. 9.

Moving from Village: Mother cannot move before player throws a taba. Subsequent throws dictate movement. 7. Tabas: Once out of village, a taba throw doesn't move mother; player counts tabas (currency). 8. Sharing Spaces: Allowed. 9. Reaching Well (Exact Throw): Must be exact. Shortfall can be made up by paying 1 taba per extra space. If throw overshoots, it's lost. 10. Passing Turn: After throwing a 2 and moving, pass sticks. 11. At Well: Spend 2 tabas to wash clothes. If not enough tabas, wait and gather via throws. Throws of 2, 3, 6 can be noted for return journey. 12. Return Journey: Pay 2 tabas to start. Gather tabas if needed. 13. Reaching Village (Return): Exact throw, option to spend tabas (as per rule 9). 14. Winning & Hyena: First mother back to village wins. Player now controls hyena. Play continues for others. 15. Hyena Movement: Leaves village on payment of 2 tabas. Moves double mother's rate (4, 6, or 12 spaces). Collects tabas like mothers. 16. Hyena at Well: Pays TEN tabas for a drink before returning. 17.

Mancala (Family of Games),"Mancala is a family of board games with hundreds of variants. General principles: Played on a board with a grid of holes (usually 2, 3, or 4 rows). Pieces are seeds, beans, or stones. Players control a half of the board. Movement involves picking up all pieces in a hole and sowing them one by one in adjacent holes along a set course. Turns can involve multiple 'laps'. Captures vary by game: e.g., from the hole the last piece is dropped into, or from opponent's holes opposite one's own, often determined by the number of pieces in the last-sown-into hole. Specific rules vary greatly between individual Mancala games.",Cyningstan (http://www.cyningstan.com/game/259/mancala) - General description.

Oware,"Equipment
The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. A typical oware board has two straight rows of six pits, called ""houses"", and optionally one large ""score"" house at each end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve smaller houses.

Oware game variant. On this board players would sit left and right.
Boards may be elaborately carved or simple and functional; they may include a pedestal, or be hinged to fold lengthwise or crosswise and latch for portability and storage with the seeds inside. While most commonly located at either end, scoring houses may be placed elsewhere, and the rows need not be straight. When a board has a hinged cover like a diptych, the scoring houses may be carved into the two halves of the cover, and so be in front of the players during play. The ground may also be used as a board; players simply scoop two rows of pits out of the earth.

In the Caribbean, the seeds are typically nickernuts, which are smooth and shiny. Beads and pebbles are also sometimes used. In the West, some cheaper sets use oval-shaped marbles. Some tourist sets use cowrie shells.

Objective
The game starts with four seeds in each house. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to win the game. Since there is an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24.

Sowing

A player sowing seeds.
Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under their control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. The starting house is always left empty; if it contained 12 (or more) seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. The diagram shows the result of sowing from house E.

Knowing the number of seeds in each house is, of course, important to game play. When there are many seeds in a house, sometimes enough to make a full lap of the board or more, they cannot easily be counted by eye, and their number is often guarded by the player who controls that house. This may be done by repeatedly moving the seeds in the house. A player may count the seeds when contemplating a move; in such cases the last few are usually counted in the hand to avoid revealing their number.

Capturing
In Oware Abapa, capturing occurs only when a player brings the count of an opponent's house to exactly two or three with the final seed he sowed in that turn.[5] This always captures the seeds in the corresponding house, and possibly more: If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is reached which does not contain two or three seeds or does not belong to the opponent. The captured seeds are placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). However, if a move would capture all of an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game, and the seeds are instead left on the board. (However, see discussion on Grand Slam variations below). In the adjacent diagram, the lower player would capture all the seeds in houses e, d, and c but not b (as it has four seeds) or a (since it is not contiguous to the other captured houses).

Let the opponent play
The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in their own territory, ending the game.

Winning
The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, the game ends when each player has seeds in his holes and then each player captures the seeds on their side of the board.

Ludus Anglicorum,"The notation used in the original manuscript is illustrated. In this case, Black sits at the bottom by the side marked nф and assembles all 15 men on his or her home point, point ""a"". White sits at the top by the side marked am and assembles all 15 white men opposite on point ""ф"". Black moves anticlockwise; White clockwise.[3]

Black's aim is to move the 15 men on point ""a"" along the remaining 11 points of the opposing side of the board and then in the reverse direction on the home side towards the bearing table, tф. White moves from point ""ф"" clockwise around to White's bearing table, af.[6]

To move their men, players roll the dice and assign each roll to one man, moving it the corresponding number of points forward. Two rolls may be combined e.g. a 4 and 3 may be used to move a man 7 points. Men may move to any point except one occupied by two or more opposing men.[6]

If a point is occupied by just one enemy piece and a man is moved to that point, or 'rests' on that point as part of a two- or three-dice move, the opponent's man must be removed and re-entered. When a man is removed, its owner may not play any men on the board until the removed piece has been re-entered; this must be done into the player's home table e.g. if Black rolls a 4, the man may enter point ""d"" if it is not blocked by the opponent or already occupied by a black piece.[2][a]

When all 15 men have safely reached the bearing table, they are borne off. The first player to do so, wins. To successfully bear a man off, the player must roll the exact number needed to take it off the board e.g. Black needs a 6 if the man is on ""t"", a 5 if on ""u"" and so on. If the die roll is higher than the number required by the furthest man, then that man may be borne off.[1]

Lympolding and lurching
Another way of winning is to create a blockade such that the opponent cannot move. For example, if Black occupies n to r with two men each and creates a situation where White has 8 men queued up on ""a"" waiting to be borne off while having a man on each point of the home board plus one waiting to be re-entered, he is stuck. This is called lympolding.[5][7]

Another way of winning is called lurching which is achieved, for example, if Black secures the opponent's entire home board and the ""s"" point.[5][7]

Shelagh Lewins interprets lympolding and lurching slightly differently. Lympolding occurs when a player cannot re-enter a man because all points in the home table are blocked by the opponent or occupied by friendly men. Lurching is when a player is unable to move due to any combination of a blockade and a pile up of men on the final point. In either case, Lewins only requires the player to miss a turn.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_Anglicorum,1941,,
Derrah,"No. of Players

Two

Equipment

Derrah and its variations may be played on a 7x6 square grid, 6x6 square grid, or 5x6 square grid but always uses twelve each of black and white counters. 

History

Several games of this type are played in the Sahara and North Africa. Derrah is documented more thoroughly than others and is played by the Dakarkari people of Nigeria.

Objective

The goal is to from orthogonal rows of three counters, thereby removing one of your opponent’s counters for each row formed. When a player has lost all but two counters they have lost the game.

Play

In the first phase of the game players alternate turns placing one counter at a time on any vacant square on the board. When all 24 counters have been placed, the second phase begins. In the second phase, alternate turns entail moving any one piece orthogonally (not diagonally) to an adjacent vacant square. When a (horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal) row of three is formed the player removes one of his opponent’s counters from the board. Rows made during the initial placement do not count; nor do rows made of four or more counters or rows derived by removing an end piece from a row of four. If a move makes a row in two ways, two captures may be made.

Variations 

Variations often concern methods of entry and alignments of more than three counters.

The game of Wari played on the Gold Coast allows initial placing of orthogonal rows of three, four, or more counters but does not allow captures until all counters are entered. The removal of an end counter from a line of four or more to make a row of three does not permit a capture.

The game of Dala from Sudan is another variation. Played on a 6 x 6 grid, counters are entered two at a time and the four central squares must be filled first. Here, an initial line of four or more may be reduced to a line of three during movement and entitle that player to a capture.

In Alkarhat, each player commences with 13 counters, rather than 12; again playing on a 6x6 grid.

The game of Shiva, also called Kare or Karnun, from Nigeria prohibits initial placement of rows larger than two and also does not allow any rows larger than three to be formed during movement. Here, once a line has been made none of its counters may move again. A player wins outright by making three lines of three before his opponent makes one. It is played on a grid of 5x6 or 6x6 squares.

The game of Dra, also called Dili, Wali, or Kyoti, from the Sahara is played on a grid of 5x6 cells. Like Shiva, it prohibits initial placement of rows larger than two and also does not allow any rows larger than three to be formed during movement. If a move makes a row in two ways, only one capture can be made.",https://sites.google.com/site/boardandpieces/list-of-games/derrah,1981,,
Morabaraba,"Morabaraba is accessible and easy to learn, and games can be played quickly, but the strategic and tactical aspects of the game run deep. While it may be played on specially produced boards (or simulated by computer software as a video game), it is simple enough that a board can easily be scratched on a stone or into sand, with coins or pebbles (or whatever comes to hand) used as the pieces. The description below is compatible with Mind Sports South Africa's ""generally accepted rules"".


There are three main phases to the game:

Placing the cows
Moving the cows
Flying the cows
Placing the cows
The board is empty when the game begins. Each player has 12 pieces, known as ""cows""; one player has light cows and the other has dark cows
The player with the dark cows moves first
Each turn consists of placing a cow on an empty intersection on the board
The aim is to create a ""mill"": a row of three cows on any line drawn on the board
If a player forms a mill, he or she may remove or ""shoot"" one of the opponent's cows. The shot cow is removed from the board and not placed again. A cow in a mill may not be shot unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills, in which case any cow may be shot.
Even if a move creates more than one mill, only one cow can be shot in a single move
Moving the cows
After all the cows have been placed, each turn consists of moving a cow to an empty adjacent intersection
As before, completing a mill allows a player to shoot one of the opponent's cows. Again, this must be a cow which is not in a mill, unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills.
Players are allowed to ""break"" their own mills
A mill may be broken and remade repeatedly by shuffling cows back and forth. Each time the mill is remade, one of the opponent's cows is shot. Of course, by breaking the mill the player exposes the cows which were in a mill to the risk of being shot by the opponent on his or her next turn.
In the ""generally accepted rules"" published by Mind Sports South Africa, a mill which is broken to form a new mill can not be formed again on the next move.
In some instances (in a competitive game) a chess rule ""touch is a move"" apply for time management. But this rule will be applied depending on the opinion of players.
Flying the cows
When a player has only three cows remaining, desperate measures are called for. This player's cows are allowed to ""fly"" to any empty intersection, not just adjacent ones.
If one player has three cows and the other player has more than three cows, only the player with three cows is allowed to fly
Finishing the game
A win occurs if one opponent has just two cows or if there are no moves.
If either player has only three cows and neither player shoots a cow within ten moves, the game is drawn
If one person cheats, then the other one wins by default
If one player picks up all cows while the play is still on, the player whose cows are on the board wins by default.
If a player plays twice before the other player, the player who did not play wins by default.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morabaraba#:~:text=,cows%20are%20in%20mills%2C%20in",-1440,,
Omweso,"The game requires an Oware board and 48 seeds.

A typical Oware board has two straight rows of six holes, called ""houses"", and optionally one large house at either end. Each player controls the six houses on his side of the board, and owns the store on his right.

Initially there are four seeds in each hole




Initial Position


Players take turns moving the seeds.

On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house.

If the starting house contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house.

If the last seed was placed into an opponent's house that brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's store (or set aside if the board has no stores).

If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on.

However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds (often after a full sowing around the board known as ""Grand Slam""), the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. A variation common in Africa and promoted by the Ivory Coast champion allows Grand Slams to capture, if they result in the cumulative capture of more than 24 seeds (thus ending the game).

The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If all houses of the opponent are empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds (""to feed"").

The game ends, when a player can't move at the start of his turn or when the game has been reduced to an endless cycle that is a board position repeats with the same player to move and seeds on either side of the board.

If the game ended because a player couldn't move, his opponent captures all seeds that are still in his holes.

If the game ended because seeds continued to circle around the board and no player could capture them, they are divided between the players, when each one of them has seeds on his side. Each player gets the seeds, which are in his holes.

Sometimes it is agreed that the game should end as soon as one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds.

The player who captured more seeds wins the game. The game is a draw, when both players have captured 24 seeds.",https://mancala.fandom.com/wiki/Oware,1255,,

Each player owns and 'sows' (moves) seeds only around the two nearest rows of holes. The objective is to leave the opponent with an empty inner row. Players take alternate moves.

One 'turn' or 'move' may consist of several 'lifts' and 'sowings', and possibly of several captures. A move starts by the player lifting the seeds in one hole and sowing them one by one into the subsequent holes, moving either in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, as desired.

There are three possible results of this initial sowing:

the last seed falls in an occupied inner-row hole and seeds are captured (""eaten"") from the adversary's inner-row hole immediately opposite.
the last seed falls in an occupied hole in the outer row, or one in the inner row opposite which no seeds are available for capture. In this case all the seeds in that last hole (including the newcomer) are lifted and sown on (a 'relay') in the same direction;
the last seed falls in an empty hole and the move peters out (the player ""sleeps"") and play passes to the opponent;
A move of the first kind is called mtaji. The other two are known as takata.

Captured seeds are sown along the player's inner row starting at the end-hole (kichwa) in the same direction as the previous sowing. Thus if the move leading up to the capture was anti-clockwise the captured seeds will be sown in starting at the anti-clockwise kichwa (see Figure 1).

However, if the capture is from the first, second, seventh or eighth hole of the inner row (called kimbi) the captured seeds are sown in from the nearest end-hole. This may mean that the direction of sowing is reversed. No change of direction is made when making a 'relay' (not a capture) from a kimbi hole.

During a mtaji, every subsequent 'relay' may occasion a capture if the circumstances described above recur.

A 'singleton' cannot be lifted and sown on. A player left only with 'singletons' to move has thus lost the game.

Fifteen is the highest number of seeds that can be lifted to begin a mtaji move. Any higher number of seeds can only be lifted for a takata move or, when a previous sowing ends there, for a subsequent relay of the same move, whether takata or mtaji.

Each move can be defined as mtaji or takata before it is played. If no initial lift endangers any of the adversary's seeds then takata is the only possibility. At no point subsequently during the same takata will a capture occur - moves ending in occupied holes cause a further relay, whether there are seeds in the opposite hole or not.

A takata move is allowed only if no mtaji is available. If several mtaji possibilities exist, any may be chosen.

No takata move may be made from an outer-row hole if an alternative takata move is possible from the inner row. However, a mtaji move may begin from either row subject to the limits on the number of seeds involved.

All seeds in the outer row are safe, captures only occur from inner-row holes.

A player loses the game when their inner row has no seeds.

A takata move from an end hole which is the only occupied inner row hole, if played back - across the players outer row, results in immediate defeat. The rationale is that the inner row is empty (even if the lone hole contains more than 8 seeds and so would eventually have reached back round onto the inner row).",http://gamecabinet.com/rules/Bao2.html,1520,,
Ampe ,"How to play:

The group chooses a leader. The other players stand in a semi-circle facing the leader.
The leader and the player at one end of the semi-circle face each other. They clap hands and jump. They jump again, this time placing one foot forward.
If they put the same foot forward, the leader is out and the player takes the leader’s place. If they each put a different foot forward, the leader remains.
The same or new leader then repeats this process with the next player in the semi-circle, and so the game continues.",https://africa.com/best-african-games/,2001,,
Kudoda,"There’s a few variations of this game, all which need at least three players to make it fun. In Kudoda, players sit in a circle around a wooden or metal bowl filled with 20 to 30 small stones or marbles. The first player picks up one of the stones and throws it up in the air. It’s all about quick fingers. Before it drops down, the player tries to pick up as many other stones in the bowl as he/she can.

Juksei,"The object of the game is to knock over a peg that is planted in a sandpit over a distance of between 10 and 16 m (depending on age and gender). It is played in teams with usually four members each. Each member has two skeis (and thus two turns). The playing field consists of two pits juxtaposed in opposite directions, so that play can take place in both directions. Each time a team member knocks over the peg, he gets three points. If the peg wasn't knocked out, the team lying closest to the position of the peg scores as many points as they have skeis closer to the peg than their opponent's closest skei. The first team to get exactly 23 points first wins the game. If the team gets more than 23 points, they start from 0.",https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Jukskei,1743,South africa,
DIBEKE,"The captains toss a coin to decide who will be the defenders and who the attackers.
The match facilitator blows the whistle twice for the attackers, the roller and the
defenders to take up their respective positions on the pitch. This occurs at the start of
the match, the start of each round, and every time play is resumed after the half-time
break or an interruption (i.e. when the ball has gone ‘dead’).
At the start or re-start of play, the attackers stand next to each other in a single line in
the attackers’ box. The defenders position themselves in the defenders’ area (on the
centre half of the pitch opposite the attackers’ half of the pitch). No defender may
stand outside the pitch before the ball has been kicked.
The roller takes up position in the roller’s semi-circle in the middle of the field.
When the match facilitator starts the game, the roller calls out the letter of
an attacker (shown on the jersey of the player) and rolls the ball along the ground
towards the attackers’ area. The ball must remain on the ground and within the
roller’s area until it is kicked by the attacker. The ball is rolled under-arm. The speed
of the ball is of no consequence. 
The attacker whose letter was called immediately steps into the kicker’s box and
kicks the ball beyond the centre line. After kicking the ball, he or she must run to the
attackers’ box on the opposite end of the pitch. The kicker’s team-mates may
‘help’ the kicker by running with him or her to the attackers’ box on the opposite side
of the pitch.
The defenders try to catch the ball or retrieve it as soon as possible. After retrieving
the ball, the defenders ‘eliminate’ the players of the attacking team by throwing the
ball at them – trying to hit them with the ball. If an attacker is hit, then he or she is
‘out’ for the rest of that round.
If the attackers arrive safely at the other end (in the attackers’ box), then they are safe
to continue to play until they are all out and the teams change around (attackers
become defenders and vice versa). The attackers cannot be hit while they are in the
attackers’ box or in their home box",https://www.ulwaziprogramme.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Indigenous-Games-Rule-Book-Aug-2007.pdf,1225,,

Royal Game of Ur,"The Game of Ur is a race game[8][9][12] and it is probably an ancestor of the tables family of games that are still played today and include backgammon.[8][9] The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven game pieces, similar to those used in draughts or checkers.[8] One set of pieces is white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots.[6][8] The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined by a ""narrow bridge"" of two boxes.[12]

The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy.[8] Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice.[6][8] Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up.[6][8] The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn.[12] A single game can last up to half an hour.[8]

The objective of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course and off the board before their opponent.[8] On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, suggesting that one side of the board belongs to one player and the opposite side to the other player.[6] When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture.[8]

When it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning.[8] This means there are six ""safe"" squares and eight ""combat"" squares.[8] There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.[8]

When a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game.[8] A player is not required to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity.[8] Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.[8]

All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row.[6][12] According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. Finkel also states that when a piece lands on any of the three rosettes, the player gets an extra roll.[12]

In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one.[8] If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board.[8] Once a player removes all their pieces off the board in this manner, that player wins the game.","https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~pbarfuss/On_the_Rules_for_the_Royal_Game_of_Ur.pdf

A referee controls the match and a timekeeper controls the rounds in each bout. A bout consists of three rounds of one minute each.

Rules and scoring
Penalty points are deducted for every transgression committed, while the judges have the power to disqualify players. The following constitutes a transgression:

Hitting ‘no hit areas’, namely the pubic section below the waist (kumhlaba wamadoda, meaning ‘the land of men’) and behind the head.
Hitting an opponent during a break.
Hitting an opponent when he or she is down.
Prodding or attacking the opponent with the defence stick.
