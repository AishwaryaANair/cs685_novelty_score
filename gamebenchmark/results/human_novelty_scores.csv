H0,"Patolli is an ancient Aztec board game that takes its name from the Aztec word for bean - patolli, meaning fava or kidney bean. The game is played on a curious diagonal cross-shaped board with red and blue markers and 5 bean-shaped tokens as dice. Patolli was associated with gambling and players often wagered vast treasures on its outcome.

The game consists of throwing beans (dice) to bring tokens onto the board, and move them towards an exit ramp at the other end. Tokens are safe on some squares, but mostly can be ""eaten"" if an opposing player lands on them.

The Kirk edition of the game includes a 49-page booklet on the history and background to the game.",300,10.0
H1,"The teams would face each other on the court. The object in the end was to get the ball through the stone hoop. This was extremely difficult, and so if it actually happened the game would be over. In fact, according to historian Manuel Aguilar-Morenao, some courts didn't even have rings. Another important rule was that the ball was never allowed to touch the ground. Players couldn't hold or even touch the ball with their hands - only the elbows, knees, hips and head were used. As you may imagine, this made for a very fast paced game, and the players had to constantly throw themselves against the surface of the court to keep the ball from landing. The players were skillful, and the ball could stay in the air for an hour or more.


Because it was so hard to get the ball through the hoops, there were other objects as well. Players could hit one of the six markers along the sides of the court. Or, they would be given points for other skillful plays. Fouls were also given if the players couldn't get the ball across the centre line, or if they touched the ball with the wrong part of the body, such as the hand or calf.",1400,7.105586528778076
H2,"A game of snow snake is played by four teams, called ""corners"", who compete in trying to throw their wooden ""snow snakes"" the furthest along a long trough, or track, of snow. The game is divided into rounds, and in a round each team gets four throws. At the end of each round, two points are awarded to the team of the person who made the furthest throw, and one point is awarded for the second furthest throw. Play continues until one of the teams wins, by achieving a certain predetermined number of points (usually 7 or 11).[3]

There are two roles on a snow snake team: the Player, and the Goaler. The main role of a Goaler is to craft and maintain a team's wooden ""snow snakes"" in between games. The Goaler is also tasked with selecting which will be used for each throw during the game. A Player, meanwhile, is someone who throws the snow snakes during a game.",1500,7.868010997772217
H3,"The game was played by two teams with an equal number of men. The object was to get a tiny, walnut-sized, leather-covered ball through a goal using sticks shaped somewhat like small tennis rackets. The size of the field depended on the size of the teams and the availability of suitable terrain. The Cherokees were among the first to play consistently on a field about 100 yards in length, although some fields were much larger. There was no time limit; the first team to score 12 times won. Any strategy to score was acceptable, including biting, choking, and even banging each other on the head with the rackets. There were no time-outs or substitutions, but if a player was knocked out his opponent had to leave the game also.",1636,7.911048889160156
H4,"Double Ball gets its name from two small balls that are attached to each other with a leather thong. The balls/thong are thrown and caught using a curved stick. Ball shape, size and materials varied by region, as did the specific rules. However, in general terms, the objective of the game was for one team to throw or “pass” the balls, using their sticks to catch the connecting leather thong and re-throw the balls on to another team member, making forward progress.

Points were earned by hitting a target, or goal established in each team’s “end-zone.” Often, this goal was a wicket, made of crotched poles about six feet tall, having a bar fastened across the top. The balls could not be allowed to touch the ground from the time an umpire tossed them into the air to begin play. The team that allows the balls to fall, loses a point.",1885,6.648917198181152

H12,"This game, sometimes called the hidden ball game, was played by two groups of men. The players sat opposite each other on a blanket. Four moccasins were placed in a row between the two groups. One of the groups watched as a token or ball was hidden under one of the moccasins by the other group. The players made pretenses of hiding and removing the token in an effort to make it more difficult to discover the actual location of the token. The group watching then guessed under which moccasin the token had been hidden. The Ojibwa, Ho-Chunk, and Menominee used a “striking stick” to turn over the moccasin where they thought the token was hidden. If the player guessed the correct shoe, four points were scored while four points were subtracted if the wrong shoe was picked. Sticks were used to keep track of the score.",1801,7.848115921020508

H18,"The game of Pelota Mixteca dates from pre-Colombian times and is similar to the tennis, only with five players (sometimes nine) per team. It is played with a ball made of rubber, stocking thread and suede lining weighing about 330 grams. The players pound the ball back and forth using large, elaborately decorated suede gloves weighing between 7 and 12 pounds. The ball can only bounce once.

The game begins with a serve consisting of a rebound in a stone on the ground at the player's feet. The first rebound should land in a square called cajón at mid-field. The player called el Bolillero can return the ball without it hitting the ground, which is known as ""de Bolea"". Generally, the shots are so strong that at times the game is only carried out among the Bolilleros or between el Resto and el Contrarresto. It is hard to describe the shouting and the joy of the spectators when this happens. Only when the ball is intercepted in the center of the game field, the dispute is settled among los Rayeros.

H24,"The game consists of throwing a metal puck/disc (called a tejo) across a field at a 1-by-1-metre (3.3 by 3.3 ft) board at a distance of approximately 18.5 metres (20.2 yd). The board is covered with clay and set at a 45-degree angle.

Wooden frames covered in clay act as a protective board to keep the tejo from hitting other elements or people in the neighboring area, and are called tablas. Inside the tablas, there is a metal pipe or car spring, designed to cushion the impacts of the tejo. This pipe is the target where the tejo is meant to hit. The pipe is set at the same angle as the frame (45 degrees).

The tejo must be thrown from within the throwing area, and the goal is to impact the inside of the target at the end of the field. A chief characteristic of the sport is its use of small, exploding targets that contain gunpowder, commonly known as mechas. These usually triangle-shaped envelopes with explosive material inside are set on the edges of the pipe. When struck by the tejo, they explode loudly, creating a sound similar to the one created by a small revolver. Modern adaptations of tejo also exist, with electronic sensors instead of the traditional mechas being used to detect a hit",1492,10.0

H35,"Equipment
The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. A typical oware board has two straight rows of six pits, called ""houses"", and optionally one large ""score"" house at each end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve smaller houses.

Oware game variant. On this board players would sit left and right.
Boards may be elaborately carved or simple and functional; they may include a pedestal, or be hinged to fold lengthwise or crosswise and latch for portability and storage with the seeds inside. While most commonly located at either end, scoring houses may be placed elsewhere, and the rows need not be straight. When a board has a hinged cover like a diptych, the scoring houses may be carved into the two halves of the cover, and so be in front of the players during play. The ground may also be used as a board; players simply scoop two rows of pits out of the earth.

In the Caribbean, the seeds are typically nickernuts, which are smooth and shiny. Beads and pebbles are also sometimes used. In the West, some cheaper sets use oval-shaped marbles. Some tourist sets use cowrie shells.

Objective
The game starts with four seeds in each house. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than one's opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to win the game. Since there is an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24.

Sowing

A player sowing seeds.
Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under their control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. The starting house is always left empty; if it contained 12 (or more) seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. The diagram shows the result of sowing from house E.

Knowing the number of seeds in each house is, of course, important to game play. When there are many seeds in a house, sometimes enough to make a full lap of the board or more, they cannot easily be counted by eye, and their number is often guarded by the player who controls that house. This may be done by repeatedly moving the seeds in the house. A player may count the seeds when contemplating a move; in such cases the last few are usually counted in the hand to avoid revealing their number.

Capturing
In Oware Abapa, capturing occurs only when a player brings the count of an opponent's house to exactly two or three with the final seed he sowed in that turn.[5] This always captures the seeds in the corresponding house, and possibly more: If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is reached which does not contain two or three seeds or does not belong to the opponent. The captured seeds are placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). However, if a move would capture all of an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game, and the seeds are instead left on the board. (However, see discussion on Grand Slam variations below). In the adjacent diagram, the lower player would capture all the seeds in houses e, d, and c but not b (as it has four seeds) or a (since it is not contiguous to the other captured houses).

Let the opponent play
The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in their own territory, ending the game.

Winning
The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, the game ends when each player has seeds in his holes and then each player captures the seeds on their side of the board.

H36,"The notation used in the original manuscript is illustrated. In this case, Black sits at the bottom by the side marked nф and assembles all 15 men on his or her home point, point ""a"". White sits at the top by the side marked am and assembles all 15 white men opposite on point ""ф"". Black moves anticlockwise; White clockwise.[3]

Black's aim is to move the 15 men on point ""a"" along the remaining 11 points of the opposing side of the board and then in the reverse direction on the home side towards the bearing table, tф. White moves from point ""ф"" clockwise around to White's bearing table, af.[6]

To move their men, players roll the dice and assign each roll to one man, moving it the corresponding number of points forward. Two rolls may be combined e.g. a 4 and 3 may be used to move a man 7 points. Men may move to any point except one occupied by two or more opposing men.[6]

If a point is occupied by just one enemy piece and a man is moved to that point, or 'rests' on that point as part of a two- or three-dice move, the opponent's man must be removed and re-entered. When a man is removed, its owner may not play any men on the board until the removed piece has been re-entered; this must be done into the player's home table e.g. if Black rolls a 4, the man may enter point ""d"" if it is not blocked by the opponent or already occupied by a black piece.[2][a]

When all 15 men have safely reached the bearing table, they are borne off. The first player to do so, wins. To successfully bear a man off, the player must roll the exact number needed to take it off the board e.g. Black needs a 6 if the man is on ""t"", a 5 if on ""u"" and so on. If the die roll is higher than the number required by the furthest man, then that man may be borne off.[1]

Lympolding and lurching
Another way of winning is to create a blockade such that the opponent cannot move. For example, if Black occupies n to r with two men each and creates a situation where White has 8 men queued up on ""a"" waiting to be borne off while having a man on each point of the home board plus one waiting to be re-entered, he is stuck. This is called lympolding.[5][7]

Another way of winning is called lurching which is achieved, for example, if Black secures the opponent's entire home board and the ""s"" point.[5][7]

Shelagh Lewins interprets lympolding and lurching slightly differently. Lympolding occurs when a player cannot re-enter a man because all points in the home table are blocked by the opponent or occupied by friendly men. Lurching is when a player is unable to move due to any combination of a blockade and a pile up of men on the final point. In either case, Lewins only requires the player to miss a turn.[1]",1941,7.177353858947754
H37,"No. of Players

Two

Equipment

Derrah and its variations may be played on a 7x6 square grid, 6x6 square grid, or 5x6 square grid but always uses twelve each of black and white counters. 

History

Several games of this type are played in the Sahara and North Africa. Derrah is documented more thoroughly than others and is played by the Dakarkari people of Nigeria.

Objective

The goal is to from orthogonal rows of three counters, thereby removing one of your opponent’s counters for each row formed. When a player has lost all but two counters they have lost the game.

Play

In the first phase of the game players alternate turns placing one counter at a time on any vacant square on the board. When all 24 counters have been placed, the second phase begins. In the second phase, alternate turns entail moving any one piece orthogonally (not diagonally) to an adjacent vacant square. When a (horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal) row of three is formed the player removes one of his opponent’s counters from the board. Rows made during the initial placement do not count; nor do rows made of four or more counters or rows derived by removing an end piece from a row of four. If a move makes a row in two ways, two captures may be made.

Variations 

Variations often concern methods of entry and alignments of more than three counters.

The game of Wari played on the Gold Coast allows initial placing of orthogonal rows of three, four, or more counters but does not allow captures until all counters are entered. The removal of an end counter from a line of four or more to make a row of three does not permit a capture.

The game of Dala from Sudan is another variation. Played on a 6 x 6 grid, counters are entered two at a time and the four central squares must be filled first. Here, an initial line of four or more may be reduced to a line of three during movement and entitle that player to a capture.

In Alkarhat, each player commences with 13 counters, rather than 12; again playing on a 6x6 grid.

The game of Shiva, also called Kare or Karnun, from Nigeria prohibits initial placement of rows larger than two and also does not allow any rows larger than three to be formed during movement. Here, once a line has been made none of its counters may move again. A player wins outright by making three lines of three before his opponent makes one. It is played on a grid of 5x6 or 6x6 squares.

The game of Dra, also called Dili, Wali, or Kyoti, from the Sahara is played on a grid of 5x6 cells. Like Shiva, it prohibits initial placement of rows larger than two and also does not allow any rows larger than three to be formed during movement. If a move makes a row in two ways, only one capture can be made.",1981,7.337367534637451
H38,"Morabaraba is accessible and easy to learn, and games can be played quickly, but the strategic and tactical aspects of the game run deep. While it may be played on specially produced boards (or simulated by computer software as a video game), it is simple enough that a board can easily be scratched on a stone or into sand, with coins or pebbles (or whatever comes to hand) used as the pieces. The description below is compatible with Mind Sports South Africa's ""generally accepted rules"".


There are three main phases to the game:

Placing the cows
Moving the cows
Flying the cows
Placing the cows
The board is empty when the game begins. Each player has 12 pieces, known as ""cows""; one player has light cows and the other has dark cows
The player with the dark cows moves first
Each turn consists of placing a cow on an empty intersection on the board
The aim is to create a ""mill"": a row of three cows on any line drawn on the board
If a player forms a mill, he or she may remove or ""shoot"" one of the opponent's cows. The shot cow is removed from the board and not placed again. A cow in a mill may not be shot unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills, in which case any cow may be shot.
Even if a move creates more than one mill, only one cow can be shot in a single move
Moving the cows
After all the cows have been placed, each turn consists of moving a cow to an empty adjacent intersection
As before, completing a mill allows a player to shoot one of the opponent's cows. Again, this must be a cow which is not in a mill, unless all of the opponent's cows are in mills.
Players are allowed to ""break"" their own mills
A mill may be broken and remade repeatedly by shuffling cows back and forth. Each time the mill is remade, one of the opponent's cows is shot. Of course, by breaking the mill the player exposes the cows which were in a mill to the risk of being shot by the opponent on his or her next turn.
In the ""generally accepted rules"" published by Mind Sports South Africa, a mill which is broken to form a new mill can not be formed again on the next move.
In some instances (in a competitive game) a chess rule ""touch is a move"" apply for time management. But this rule will be applied depending on the opinion of players.
Flying the cows
When a player has only three cows remaining, desperate measures are called for. This player's cows are allowed to ""fly"" to any empty intersection, not just adjacent ones.
If one player has three cows and the other player has more than three cows, only the player with three cows is allowed to fly
Finishing the game
A win occurs if one opponent has just two cows or if there are no moves.
If either player has only three cows and neither player shoots a cow within ten moves, the game is drawn
If one person cheats, then the other one wins by default
If one player picks up all cows while the play is still on, the player whose cows are on the board wins by default.
If a player plays twice before the other player, the player who did not play wins by default.",-1440,10.0
H39,"The game requires an Oware board and 48 seeds.

A typical Oware board has two straight rows of six holes, called ""houses"", and optionally one large house at either end. Each player controls the six houses on his side of the board, and owns the store on his right.

Initially there are four seeds in each hole




Initial Position


Players take turns moving the seeds.

On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house.

If the starting house contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house.

If the last seed was placed into an opponent's house that brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's store (or set aside if the board has no stores).

If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on.

However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds (often after a full sowing around the board known as ""Grand Slam""), the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. A variation common in Africa and promoted by the Ivory Coast champion allows Grand Slams to capture, if they result in the cumulative capture of more than 24 seeds (thus ending the game).

The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If all houses of the opponent are empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds (""to feed"").

The game ends, when a player can't move at the start of his turn or when the game has been reduced to an endless cycle that is a board position repeats with the same player to move and seeds on either side of the board.

If the game ended because a player couldn't move, his opponent captures all seeds that are still in his holes.

If the game ended because seeds continued to circle around the board and no player could capture them, they are divided between the players, when each one of them has seeds on his side. Each player gets the seeds, which are in his holes.

Sometimes it is agreed that the game should end as soon as one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds.

The player who captured more seeds wins the game. The game is a draw, when both players have captured 24 seeds.",1255,5.838990211486816
H40,"The board (bao) contains four rows of eight holes.

The opening position is shown in Figure 1. Sixty-four seeds are used, with two per hole.

The first player is chosen by lot. In subsequent games the winner of the previous game plays first.

Each player owns and 'sows' (moves) seeds only around the two nearest rows of holes. The objective is to leave the opponent with an empty inner row. Players take alternate moves.

One 'turn' or 'move' may consist of several 'lifts' and 'sowings', and possibly of several captures. A move starts by the player lifting the seeds in one hole and sowing them one by one into the subsequent holes, moving either in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction, as desired.

There are three possible results of this initial sowing:

the last seed falls in an occupied inner-row hole and seeds are captured (""eaten"") from the adversary's inner-row hole immediately opposite.
the last seed falls in an occupied hole in the outer row, or one in the inner row opposite which no seeds are available for capture. In this case all the seeds in that last hole (including the newcomer) are lifted and sown on (a 'relay') in the same direction;
the last seed falls in an empty hole and the move peters out (the player ""sleeps"") and play passes to the opponent;
A move of the first kind is called mtaji. The other two are known as takata.

Captured seeds are sown along the player's inner row starting at the end-hole (kichwa) in the same direction as the previous sowing. Thus if the move leading up to the capture was anti-clockwise the captured seeds will be sown in starting at the anti-clockwise kichwa (see Figure 1).

However, if the capture is from the first, second, seventh or eighth hole of the inner row (called kimbi) the captured seeds are sown in from the nearest end-hole. This may mean that the direction of sowing is reversed. No change of direction is made when making a 'relay' (not a capture) from a kimbi hole.

During a mtaji, every subsequent 'relay' may occasion a capture if the circumstances described above recur.

A 'singleton' cannot be lifted and sown on. A player left only with 'singletons' to move has thus lost the game.

Fifteen is the highest number of seeds that can be lifted to begin a mtaji move. Any higher number of seeds can only be lifted for a takata move or, when a previous sowing ends there, for a subsequent relay of the same move, whether takata or mtaji.

Each move can be defined as mtaji or takata before it is played. If no initial lift endangers any of the adversary's seeds then takata is the only possibility. At no point subsequently during the same takata will a capture occur - moves ending in occupied holes cause a further relay, whether there are seeds in the opposite hole or not.

A takata move is allowed only if no mtaji is available. If several mtaji possibilities exist, any may be chosen.

No takata move may be made from an outer-row hole if an alternative takata move is possible from the inner row. However, a mtaji move may begin from either row subject to the limits on the number of seeds involved.

All seeds in the outer row are safe, captures only occur from inner-row holes.

A player loses the game when their inner row has no seeds.

A takata move from an end hole which is the only occupied inner row hole, if played back - across the players outer row, results in immediate defeat. The rationale is that the inner row is empty (even if the lone hole contains more than 8 seeds and so would eventually have reached back round onto the inner row).",1520,5.983034133911133

H45,"The captains toss a coin to decide who will be the defenders and who the attackers.
The match facilitator blows the whistle twice for the attackers, the roller and the
defenders to take up their respective positions on the pitch. This occurs at the start of
the match, the start of each round, and every time play is resumed after the half-time
break or an interruption (i.e. when the ball has gone ‘dead’).
At the start or re-start of play, the attackers stand next to each other in a single line in
the attackers’ box. The defenders position themselves in the defenders’ area (on the
centre half of the pitch opposite the attackers’ half of the pitch). No defender may
stand outside the pitch before the ball has been kicked.
The roller takes up position in the roller’s semi-circle in the middle of the field.
When the match facilitator starts the game, the roller calls out the letter of
an attacker (shown on the jersey of the player) and rolls the ball along the ground
towards the attackers’ area. The ball must remain on the ground and within the
roller’s area until it is kicked by the attacker. The ball is rolled under-arm. The speed
of the ball is of no consequence. 
The attacker whose letter was called immediately steps into the kicker’s box and
kicks the ball beyond the centre line. After kicking the ball, he or she must run to the
attackers’ box on the opposite end of the pitch. The kicker’s team-mates may
‘help’ the kicker by running with him or her to the attackers’ box on the opposite side
of the pitch.
The defenders try to catch the ball or retrieve it as soon as possible. After retrieving
the ball, the defenders ‘eliminate’ the players of the attacking team by throwing the
ball at them – trying to hit them with the ball. If an attacker is hit, then he or she is
‘out’ for the rest of that round.
If the attackers arrive safely at the other end (in the attackers’ box), then they are safe
to continue to play until they are all out and the teams change around (attackers
become defenders and vice versa). The attackers cannot be hit while they are in the

H52,"The Game of Ur is a race game[8][9][12] and it is probably an ancestor of the tables family of games that are still played today and include backgammon.[8][9] The Game of Ur is played using two sets of seven game pieces, similar to those used in draughts or checkers.[8] One set of pieces is white with five black dots and the other set is black with five white dots.[6][8] The gameboard is composed of two rectangular sets of boxes, one containing three rows of four boxes each and the other containing three rows of two boxes each, joined by a ""narrow bridge"" of two boxes.[12]

The gameplay involves elements of both luck and strategy.[8] Movements are determined by rolling a set of four-sided, tetrahedron-shaped dice.[6][8] Two of the four corners of each die are marked and the other two are not, giving each die an equal chance of landing with a marked or unmarked corner facing up.[6][8] The number of marked ends facing upwards after a roll of the dice indicates how many spaces a player may move during that turn.[12] A single game can last up to half an hour.[8]

The objective of the game is for a player to move all seven of their pieces along the course and off the board before their opponent.[8] On all surviving gameboards, the two sides of the board are always identical with each other, suggesting that one side of the board belongs to one player and the opposite side to the other player.[6] When a piece is on one of the player's own squares, it is safe from capture.[8]

When it is on one of the eight squares in the middle of the board, the opponent's pieces may capture it by landing on the same space, sending the piece back off the board so that it must restart the course from the beginning.[8] This means there are six ""safe"" squares and eight ""combat"" squares.[8] There can never be more than one piece on a single square at any given time, so having too many pieces on the board at once can impede a player's mobility.[8]

When a player rolls a number using the dice, they may choose to move any of their pieces on the board or add a new piece to the board if they still have pieces that have not entered the game.[8] A player is not required to capture a piece every time they have the opportunity.[8] Nonetheless, players are required to move a piece whenever possible, even if it results in an unfavorable outcome.[8]

All surviving gameboards have a colored rosette in the middle of the center row.[6][12] According to Finkel's reconstruction, if a piece is located on the space with the rosette, it is safe from capture. Finkel also states that when a piece lands on any of the three rosettes, the player gets an extra roll.[12]

In order to remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the number of spaces remaining until the end of the course plus one.[8] If the player rolls a number any higher or lower than this number, they may not remove the piece from the board.[8] Once a player removes all their pieces off the board in this manner, that player wins the game.",-2400,7.818551063537598

Age categories
Players from 5 years to 20 years of age are grouped into compatible age categories:

8-20 years (juniors)
21-25 years (intermediaries)
26 years and above (seniors)

Game description 
Two fighters (combatants) take up position inside the ring. Each fighter carries two sticks, namely the attack and the defence stick. The referee blows a whistle to start the game and the fighters try to hit their opponent with their stick, while defending themselves with the defence stick.

Three judges judge the match and record points scored by each combatant. They also record deductible points where there are infringements of the rules. Points are awarded according to the number of blows that hit the opponent’s body.
A referee controls the match and a timekeeper controls the rounds in each bout. A bout consists of three rounds of one minute each.

Rules and scoring
Penalty points are deducted for every transgression committed, while the judges have the power to disqualify players. The following constitutes a transgression:

Hitting ‘no hit areas’, namely the pubic section below the waist (kumhlaba wamadoda, meaning ‘the land of men’) and behind the head.
Hitting an opponent during a break.
Hitting an opponent when he or she is down.
Prodding or attacking the opponent with the defence stick.
Poking the opponent.
Hooking or grabbing with a stick.
Using sharpened sticks.",1700,6.846950531005859
H70,"The sport is played with a round ball (traditionally with black and white checks), which is only kicked by the feet. This excludes the goal keeper, who can use hands only in the goal area. A goal is scored when an attacking player kicks the ball into the opposition net. Games are usually low scoring. There are 11 players on the field, with some substitutions coming late in the game. If a player is substituted off they can not come back onto the field. The game consists of 45 minute halves, with a half time break.

A List of Rules
A football match is played by two teams, with each allowed no more than 11 players on the field at any one time, one of whom is a goalkeeper.
A match is played in two 45 minute halves.
The game begins with the toss of a coin, and the winning captain decides which goal to defend or to take the first kick off.
All players must use their feet head or chest to play the ball. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated goal area.
The aim of the game is to score a goal, which is achieved by kicking or heading the ball into the opposition team's goal.
If the ball completely crosses the side line, it is thrown back in by the team that was not the last to touch the ball.
The game is controlled by a central referee, and two linesmen. They award free kicks and penalties when rules are broken. For continual breaking of rules or for a bad foul, the player may shown a red card and be sent off.",1863,5.3986101150512695
H71,"The game is broken down into two 40 minute halves with a 10 minute rest period in between. The game carries no stoppage time and will end exactly on 80 minutes.
Each team can start with 15 players and up to 7 substitutes. Players that have left the field are only allowed to return if they have been treated for an injury.
The field must be roughly 100 metres long and 70 metres wide with a minimum of a 10 metre dead ball area. The H shaped goal needs to be 6 metres wide with no restrictions on height.
The field consist of the following markings; half way line, 5 metre line, 22 metre line, 10 metre line and dead ball line. Also included is a centre spot for restarting the game after a try, penalty or drop goal has been scored.
The game must have one referee and two touch judges. It’s the referee’s job to time keep, make decisions throughout the game and keep order on the field. The two touch judges can assist the referee with decisions and also notify the referee when players are in touch (out of playing boundaries).
The game will stop if a player is fouled, the ball goes out of play or a try or drop goal is scored.
The defending team must tackle a player by grabbing a hold and pulling them to the floor. A tackle cannot be made above shoulder height and doing so will cause the referee to award a foul.
Once the ball goes into touch a line out is called. Up to 7 players can enter a line out and any of these players can be lifted in order to catch the ball being thrown in. Both teams can compete to win the ball.
A successful conversion, penalty or kick at goal only occurs when the player manages to kick the ball through the top section of the goal. If a player is unsuccessful the ball is still in play until it crosses one of the playing fields boundaries.
Attacking players must remain behind the ball whilst active or run the risk of being called offside. Players not interfering with play can be in front of ball but must get back behind the ball before then again interfering with play.",1845,6.273251533508301
H72,"Players: Each team has eleven players, including a captain, and they take turns playing offense (batting) and defense (fielding).
Innings: In cricket, each team takes turns batting and fielding. A full game (test match) consists of two innings per team, with the exception of some shorter formats of the game such as ODIs and T20s. (see types of cricket)
Equipment: The equipment used in cricket includes a bat, a ball, and wickets. The bat is flat on one side and can be no more than 38 inches in length. The ball is typically made of cork, covered in leather, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces. Wickets are made of three wooden stumps and two bails.
Scoring: The basic way to score runs is by hitting the ball and running to the opposite end of the pitch. If the ball is hit to the boundary, a four or six runs are awarded depending on whether it bounces before crossing the boundary or not. The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
Bowling: The bowling team takes turns bowling the ball to the batsmen, and the objective is to hit the wickets or get the batsmen out in another way (see ways of getting out). The bowler must not throw the ball but instead bowl it overhand with a straight arm.
Batting: The batting team tries to score runs while protecting their wickets. Each batsman takes turns facing the bowler, and the objective is to hit the ball and score runs. A batsman is out if they hit the ball in the air and it is caught by a fielder, or if the ball hits the wicket and the bails are dislodged (there are other less common ways of getting out too).
Extras: If a no-ball or a wide ball is bowled, the batting team is awarded an extra run (but the score is not credited to the batsman). Other extras are byes and leg byes, and penalty runs.
Fielding: The fielding team tries to take wickets and prevent the batting team from scoring runs. Fielders can catch the ball or stop it and throw it to the wickets to get a run-out.",1744,7.5621490478515625
H73,"Inter-county matches consist of two 35-minute halves, while club games are 30 minutes per half.

In Gaelic football, players are allowed to carry the ball in their hands and it can be kicked or hand-passed. After every four steps the player must bounce or solo the ball. A solo involves dropping the ball onto your boot and kicking it back into your hand. You cannot bounce the ball twice in succession but you can solo as many times as you wish. The ball cannot be lifted straight off the ground - a player must put his boot under it.

Shoulder-to-shoulder contact is permitted, while a player can slap the ball out of an opponent's hand. More than one player can tackle the player in possession but their tackle must be aimed at the ball. Deliberate body contact such as punching, tripping, jersey pulling or a full frontal charge is forbidden, as is blocking an opponent's shot with the foot.

In hurling, the ball can be struck on the ground or in the air - with the hurley or boot - but it must be lifted off the ground with your hurley. The ball can be carried in your hand for a maximum of four steps. After that you can bounce the ball on the hurley and back to your hand, but you cannot catch the ball more than twice. Players get around this by balancing the ball on their hurley while running.

Players can block an opponent's strike using their hurley. They can also hook a player's hurley as he is attempting the strike the ball. Like football, shoulder-to-shoulder contact is also permitted.


Scoring
A goal is scored when the ball crosses the goalline between the posts and under the crossbar, while a point is scored when the ball goes over the crossbar. A goal is the equivalent of three points. Teams' scores are written in a goals-points format. For example, 2-10 is two goals and 10 points, which is a total of 16 points.

A goal is signalled by the umpire raising a green flag, while a white flag signals a point. The game restarts with the goalkeeper kicking out the ball from the 13-metre line.",1855,7.298985004425049
H74," The pitch : a large rectangular field.

2. The stick : called a hurley or hurl, a curved piece of ash.

3. The ball : called a 'sliotar', small and firm, about the size of a medium orange; a leather cover over a fibre-wrapped core.

4. The score : comprises both points and goals, a goal being equal to three points. Scores are obtained by propelling the sliotar with stick, foot or palm, over (for a point) or under (for a goal) the cross-section of the H-shaped goal, and between the upright posts.

5. The team : 15 on each side
Up to three players may be replaced during the course of the game by replacements from the bench ; it is usual to name six possible replacements at the beginning.

6. Control : One referee, assisted by two linesman (touch judges) and four umpires, two at each goal, control the flag. The umpires' function is to signal scores or wides.

7. The play : the referee starts the match by throwing the ball between the four players at the centre. The ball may be struck, kicked, caught (in one hand only), or delivered with a smack of the open hand; it may NOT be thrown. This flexibility gives the game a speed and excitement that is noticeably absent from a ground-only game such as hockey. A good deal of physical contact is tolerated, but deliberately striking another player with the stick is always an offence. A goal-keeper has some protection as long as he stays within his goal area, but if he leaves this he is no more favoured than any other player. A very distinctive feature of the game is called 'soloing', where a player balances the sliotar on the wide part ('bas') of the hurley, and runs with it balanced on the stick for an unrestricted distance as opposition players try to dispossess him. Play lasts for either 60 or 70 minutes depending on the status of the match, with the referee also acting as timekeeper. After a score or wide, play is re-started by a player, usually the goalkeeper, 'pucking out' : driving the ball from the hand into the centre of the pitch. When the ball escapes over the sideline it is driven back into play off the ground; this is known as a sideline 'cut'. The linesman's function is to place the sliotar for this, and to nominate which team is to take it, the side that last touched the ball in play surrendering the cut to the other.",1855,6.850543022155762
H75,"Two teams (usually of six or twelve players a side) play on a field of similar proportions and size to a soccer pitch. The players use Camans (hooked/curved sticks with a triangular cross section) to strike the shinty ball, either in the air or on the ground, with the intention of scoring a goal. As in soccer, a goalkeeper guards the goal nets, which measure 12 feet across and 10 feet high. A shinty match is either 30 minutes (for six-a-side) or 90 minutes (for twelve-a-side) in length, divided into two halves with a short break between. A referee regulates play, enforcing rules and calling fouls for illegal and/or dangerous play. There are also side judges and goal judges to assist in calling side-outs, end-outs and goals. A more detailed explanation of the rules can be found elsewhere on the US Camanachd site (here) and a full set of rules and regulations, as well as rules for shinty/hurling hybrid matches, can be found at the Camanachd Association site here.",1893,5.54555606842041
H76,"The ball (football sized), must be passed from hand to hand. To score a goal, the ball must pass through the Korf (Dutch for “basket” – similar in design to a wastepaper basket with no base). These are suspended three and a half metres off the floor (much higher than you can jump – no slam dunks!), and situated in the centre of the two halves of the pitch. This means play can move around the posts, allowing much more movement and fluidity.

One of the most original rules of the sport is the Defending law. This effectively states that an attacker cannot shoot if their defender is within arm’s length of them. To shoot in this circumstance is a foul, punished by the ball being passed to the defenders. The ramifications of this rule are tremendous. It immediately creates a game where the aim is to create space for yourself and your team.mates. It also removes most of a height disadvantage, as you can still stop your attacker from shooting without having to physically block the ball.

Running with the ball is not allowed, but there is a certain amount of flexibility. If you catch the ball while moving, you are allowed a couple of steps to either bring yourself to a stop or to release the ball. This creates the possibility to use a “running-in shot” (similar to a lay-up in basketball). This complicates the defender’s job, as they must try to stay close to their attacker (within arm’s length to stop any long shots), but not so close that their attacker can run round them and score with a running in shot.

League games are generally twenty-five minutes each half but tournament games can range from 15minutes up to an hour. While the ball is at your end you can get as much exercise as you can handle, then you get a rest as the ball moves to the other half.",1902,6.365959644317627

H79,"The ball however, is not soft like a tennis ball as one would imagine, since it is after all, hit with an open hand. Instead, the ball, or pelota as it’s called locally, is made from box wood that is covered by layers of latex and wool, and is topped off with a coat of leather. For this reason, it is very important for the players to protect their hands properly for the game.

The players, or pelotaris as they are called in Basque, cut small strips of various types of adhesives that are formed into particular shapes according to where they are positioned on the hand.

In the end, they are able to create many small pads which cover the inside of their hands. These pads are referred to as “tacos.” (not to be confused with the mexican variety... totally different type of taco).

Even with the tacos covering their hands, injuries can and do happen. Pelotaris are known for having some hardcore hands.
Pelota mano can be played one on one or in couples. The rules of the game are very simple. The main rule is that the ball must hit the front wall and then the other player must return the ball while it’s in the air or off the first bounce. Another important rule concerns the serve.

After the ball hits the front wall, the ball must land between two designated lines called the “falta” and the “pasa” in order to be valid. With only this amount of basic knowledge of these few rules, you should be ready to check out a game and understand what is going on.",1929,6.56559944152832
H80,"The game is begun by a service which is always from the same end of the court (the service side). The opposite end of the court where the receiver stands is called the hazard side. The service does not alternate with each game as in lawn tennis. The server changes ends and ceases to serve only when a chase has been laid. The meaning of a chase will be explained below. To be a valid service the ball has to touch the penthouse roof at least once on the hazard side of the net and drop in the service court. If it does not touch the penthouse roof or if it hits a window or the roof it will be a fault. A second serve is available, as in lawn tennis.

A chase is laid on the floor where the ball bounces for the second time, other than in the winning area on the hazard size, without being hit by the player. On the service side a chase is laid wherever the ball bounces for a second time. On the hazard side a hazard chase is laid if the ball bounces the second time between the net and the line parallel to it furthest from the net. If it lands a second time between that line and the back wall, it is a point for the server.

The galleries on either side of the net also count as chases with the exception on the hazard side of the winning gallery. If the ball enters the winning gallery after crossing the net, either without touching the floor or after one bounce, it is a point for the server. Other winning openings which provide outright winners are the dedans on the service side and the grille on the hazard side.

If a chase is laid, the point is not won by that shot, and instead the point is kept in abeyance until the player changes ends. When the players change end, the receiver (who was previously the server) has to beat the chase. The players change ends if two chases have been laid or if one player reaches game point and there is one chase. If it is a hazard chase, the receiver will beat the chase by playing any shot which the server cannot return, either on the floor or by hitting one of the galleries on the service side. If it is a service chase, the receiver will beat the chase by the second bounce landing nearer the back wall than where the chase was laid. To assist in determining where precisely a ball bounces the second time, lines are marked on the floor at intervals of one yard. The figures above the lines on the opposite wall show the number of yards measured, on the service side, from the back wall and, on the hazard side, from the service line. The nearer a chase on the service side is to the back wall, the more difficult it is to beat.

When the players change ends, the first point to be played is the chase. The marker will call out the chase which the receiver hopes to beat. If the chase is exactly on a yard line, the marker will call out the number of yards, eg ""chase 2 and 3"" means two and a half yards from the back wall. If the chase falls between a yard and a half-yard line, the marker will call out ""better than"" or ""worse than"" the yard line, depending on whether the ball fell nearer the back wall, or further from the back wall, than the yard line. If the ball went into a gallery, the marker calls out the name of that gallery, eg the Last Gallery. Each gallery has a line on the floor opposite to the centre of the gallery. If the chase is laid on the floor between galleries, the marker calls out ""better / worse than"" say, the Second Gallery.",1599,7.193403244018555

H82,"At the very start of the game, for the first round (“la premiere mène”), we randomly draw which team goes first.

1. The starting team draws a small circle on the floor. (There are also small prefabricated plastic or metal circles that can be bought and used. But usually, tracing a circle with your foot or a stick in the dusty ground works just fine!)
Every player will then have to throw their boules from the circle during that round (in other words, this will be the starting point for all players).

2. The first player throws le cochonnet, which must land anywhere between 6 meters and 10 meters from the starting circle (otherwise it’s too easy / too hard and you need to throw the cochonnet again.)

3. A player from the opposing team throws their first boule, as close to the cochonnet as possible (since that is how you win the game!)

Remember the rule for throwing your boules when playing pétanque:

Both feet need to be within the circle and on the ground. (Therefore, there is no running before throwing the boule!)

5. The team who does not have the point throws the next boule and continues to do so until they gain the point or run out of boules.

The players within one team can play in any order, depending on whether they require the skills of one of their “pointeurs” or “tireurs”!

Pointer = to point (to throw the boule so that it gets as close to the jack as possible)
Un pointeur = a pétanque players whose task is to point / to aim at the jack.
Tirer = to knock away an opponent’s boule – a good way to get rid of the boules of the opposing team that are close to the cochonnet! By the way, if the cochonnet is moved/knocked away by a ball, the game still goes on (but it’s not very ethical to do so deliberately!)
Un tireur = a pétanque player who is skilled at knocking away the opponent’s boules (that is, not me!)
6. At the end of an end, the team with the boule closest to the cochonnet scores one point for each of its boules that is closer than the opposing team’s closest boule.

The game is played with two teams, with each team having one, two, or four players. For four player teams, each player throws one ball. For two player teams, each player throws two balls. For one player teams, each player throws four balls. When there are multiple players on a team, a playing rotation is determined at the start of a game and is maintained throughout the entire game.

A game begins with the toss of a coin. The team that wins the coin toss can choose to either have first toss of the pallina or the color of the balls they will use. To start a game, the pallina is rolled or tossed by a member of the team having won the coin toss. A player can toss the pallina any distance as long as it passes the center line of the court and stays within the boundaries of the court. If the player fails to toss the ball properly into play, a member of the opposing team will toss the ball into play. If the opposing team fails to properly toss the pallina into play, the toss reverts to a member of the original team.

The player tossing the pallina must deliver the first ball. If the ball lands outside of the boundaries of the court, that team must roll again until the first ball is put into play. Otherwise, that player steps aside and the opposing team will then deliver their balls until one of its Bocce balls is closer to the pallina or has thrown all its balls. The ""nearest ball"" rule governs the sequence of thrown balls. The side whose ball is closest to the pallina is called the ""in"" ball and the opposing side the ""out"" ball. Whenever a team gets ""in"", it steps aside and allows the ""out"" team to deliver. The other team throws until it gets its ball closer (not ties) to the pallina. This continues until both teams have thrown all their Bocce balls. After both teams have exhausted all their balls, a frame is over and points are awarded. The game resumes by teams throwing from the opposite end of the court. The team that was awarded points in the previous frame begins the next frame by tossing the pallina into play. 

All balls must be thrown underhanded. A team has the option of rolling, tossing, bouncing, etc. its ball down the court provided it does not go outside the boundaries of the court or the player does not violate the foul line. The foul line is used to deliver all balls down the court with the intent of getting a ball closer to the pallina, knocking the opponent's ball away from the pallina, or hitting the pallina so that it ends up closer to your team's ball. 

A player should not step on or over the foul line before releasing any ball. If a player steps over the foul line, the player will receive one warning. For a player that commits a second foul line infraction, the team fouled against will be awarded points as they were immediately proceeding the foul and the frame will end. The team committing the foul will be awarded no points for the frame. Or, the fouled against team may have the option of declining the penalty and completing the frame.

Any ball that goes outside the boundaries of the court is considered a dead ball and is removed immediately from play until the end of a frame. If the pallina is knocked outside the boundaries of the court during play, the frame ends with no points awarded and a new frame is started.

At the end of each frame, points will be awarded. Only one team scores in a frame. One point is awarded for each ball that is closer to the pallina than the closest ball of the opposing team. In the event that the closest ball of each team is the same distance from the pallina, no points will be awarded and the pallina returns to the team that delivered it. Only balls which are distinguishably closer to the pallina than any of the opponent's balls are awarded points. All measurements should be made from the center of the pallina to the edge of a Bocce ball. Games are played to 16 points with the first team reaching 16 points being the winner of a game.",1753,6.7484893798828125
H84,"Teams of four take it in turns to curl two rocks towards the target area with the scores being counted after all 16 rocks have been sent down the ice.
International matches have a time limit of 73 minutes per side with two timeouts lasting a minute each. 10 minutes and one timeout are permitted per extra end in the event of a tie.
The stone must be released its front edge crosses a line called the hog. Foul throws are removed from the ice before they have come to rest or in contact with other rocks.
Sweeping may be done by two members of the team up to the tee line, whilst after that point only one player can brush. After the tee one player from the opposing side may also sweep
A stone touched or moved when in play by a player or their broom will either be replaced or removed depending on the situation.
The team to go first is decided by coin toss, “draw-to-the-button” contest or, in Olympic competition using win-loss records. Subsequently the team that failed to score in the previous end has the advantage of going last, called the hammer throw.
A team may concede if they feel they cannot win, although depending on the event and stage of event they may have to wait until a certain number of ends have been completed.

H85,"Bandy - Bandy Ball is played on ice, using a single round ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal. The game is designed to be played on a rectangle of ice-field which is the same size as a football (soccer) field. Bandy also has other rules that are similar to soccer: each team has 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper. A standard bandy match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. The offside rule is also deployed. A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike soccer, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke. And all free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to this rule, however. 
In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as ""golden goal"" which means that the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.

The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball will result in a five-minute penalty.


In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as bydribbling, passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.",1882,5.76448917388916
H86,"Equipment: Archers use a bow and arrows to shoot at a target. The bows can be recurve, compound, or longbows, and the arrows must be made of specific materials and meet certain length and weight requirements.
Target: The target is generally a circular board made of straw or foam with colored rings on it. The target is typically 122 cm in diameter and is placed at a distance of 18 meters for indoor competitions and 70 meters for outdoor competitions.
Scoring: The scoring is based on where the arrow lands on the target. The center of the target, called the bullseye, is worth the most points, with the outer rings worth progressively fewer points.
Rounds: Archery competitions are made up of several rounds. Each round consists of a set number of arrows shot at a specific target. The number of rounds and arrows can vary depending on the competition.",1931,7.101646423339844
H87,"Each team has 18 players on the field, with four interchange players who can substitute for players on the field. Players wear a uniform consisting of a jumper, shorts, and boots with studs. The oval ball is made of leather and is slightly larger than a soccer ball.
Starting the Game: The game starts with a center bounce in the center square, where a neutral umpire throws the ball up into the air. The teams then compete to gain possession of the ball and move it towards their attacking goal.
Ball Movement: Players can move the ball by kicking, handballing (punching the ball with a closed fist), or running with the ball. The ball must be bounced every 15 metres if a player runs with it.
Scoring: Points are scored when the ball passes through the two large goal posts or the smaller behind posts located at either end of the oval. A goal, worth six points, is scored when the ball is kicked between the two large posts without otherwise being touched. If the ball passes between the two large posts but is not kicked, a behind worth one point is scored. A behind is also scored when the ball passes between the large and small posts.
Tackling: Players can tackle an opponent who has possession of the ball to try and win possession for their team. A successful tackle involves wrapping both arms around the opponent and bringing them to the ground. High tackles or tackles that involve contact to the head are penalized.
Marking: If a player catches the ball from a kick that has traveled at least 15 metres, without the ball touching the ground or being touched by another player, it is called a mark. The player who takes the mark is then awarded a free kick and cannot be tackled",1859,5.928637981414795
H88,"The winner of the toss can elect to serve or receive in the first game, or to choose to play at a particular end of the court. The loser of the toss makes the remaining choice.

Basic Aim
You win a rally if you hit the shuttle over the net and onto the floor of the opposing side's court.

You lose the rally if you hit the shuttle into the net, or over the net but outside of the opposing side's court. You also lose the rally if, for example, the shuttle touches you or your clothing, or if you hit it before it crosses the net.

Serving
The service courts are slightly different for singles and doubles. A shuttle on the line is ""in"". The server and receiver stand in the diagonally opposite service courts (always right hand at the start of the game) but after the serve players may move anywhere on their side of the net. The server must obey laws designed to force underhand delivery of the serve, and the receiver must stand still until the service is struck.
Matches comprise of the best of three games. Each game starts at 0-0 (called ""love-all""). If the serving side wins a rally, it scores a point, and serves again but from the alternate service court. If the receiving side wins the rally, the score remains unchanged and the service passes to the next player in turn. In singles, this is the opponent: in double it's either the partner or, if both players have just had a turn of serving, one of the opponents.

In men's singles and doubles events, 15 points wins a game. However, if the score reaches 14-14, the side which first reached 14 can choose either to play to 15, or to set the game to 17 points. The final score will reflect the sum of the points won before setting plus the points gained in setting.

Scoring in women's singles is slightly different - 11 points wins a game and there is the option to set to 13 points at 10-10

H89,"Baseball is played on a diamond-shaped field, with a base at each corner. The field is divided into two main sections: the infield and the outfield. The infield contains the bases and is where most of the action takes place. The outfield is where the ball is hit and where the defensive players attempt to catch the ball.

Each baseball team consists of nine players, and each team takes turns playing offense and defense. The game begins with a player from the defensive team, known as the pitcher, throwing the ball to a player from the offensive team, known as the batter. The batter's objective is to hit the ball into play.

The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound, and throws the ball to the batter, who is standing at the home plate. The batter attempts to hit the ball to a part of the field where the fielders cannot reach it.

If the batter hits the ball into fair territory, he or she runs to first base. If the ball is caught by a fielder, the batter is out. If the ball is hit out of the playing field, it is a home run.

After hitting the ball, the batter then runs to first base, then on to second, third and home, or as many as he can reach before the fielder returns the ball. If the batter reaches all bases and back home, he scores a run. If the batter reaches a base, and cannot continue as the ball has been returned, he can safely stay at the base and continue his run when the next batter comes to bat.

A batter is out if the fielder touches first base with the ball before the batter reaches it, or if the fielder touches the batter with the ball between bases, or if the fielder catches the ball before it lands. The batter is also out if he swings and misses three times, which is called a strike out.

When three players are out, the team's innings is over, and the opposing team has a turn at batting. Each team plays nine innings. The team with the most runs at the end of the game is the winner.

Both players must decide who is to break off first, and this is done by both players simultaneously hitting their cue ball the length of the table, hitting the cushion and returning back towards them. The player who gets their cue ball nearest to the baulk cushion at the end the shot was played gets to choose who breaks.
The red is then placed on the Billiards sport and then the player going first places their cue ball in the D and then plays the ball.
Players then take it in turn to attempt to score the most amount of points and eventually win the game. Players can score in three ways:
In-off: When your cue ball hits one of more balls and then goes down a pocket (2 / 3 points).
Pot: This is when any ball other than your cue ball goes into a pocket (2 / 3 points).
Cannon: This happens when the cue ball hits both other balls (2 points).
Players remain on the table until they fail to make a scoring shot.
Following a foul, the opposing player has the option of having the balls all put on their spots or leaving the table as it is.
The winner of the game is the first player to the points total that was declared the winning total before the game.",1886,6.99733829498291

H107,"The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlements on the fictional island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island.[9] The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game.[10] Newer editions of the game began to depict a fixed layout in their manual and recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration, the hexes of which cannot be rearranged.

Players build by spending resources (wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.

There is also a robber token, initially placed on the desert; if a player rolls 7, the robber must be moved to another hex, which will no longer produce resources until the robber is moved again. That player may also steal a resource card from another player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new placement. In addition, when a 7 is rolled, all players with 8 or more resource cards must discard their choice of half of their cards, rounded down. For example, If a player has 9 resource cards, and a 7 is rolled, the player must get rid of 4 cards.

On the player's turn, the player may spend resource cards to build roads or settlements, upgrade settlements to cities (which replace existing settlements), or buy development cards. Players can trade resource cards with each other; players may also trade off-island (in effect, with the non-player bank) at a ratio of four-to-one resources for one of any other. By building settlements adjacent to ports, players may trade with the bank at three-to-one (three of any single resource type) or two-to-one (two of a specific resource) ratios, depending on the port.

The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest army (by playing the most knight cards), grant a player additional victory points.

Resource cards can also be spent to buy a development card. There are five different types of development cards, including cards worth one victory point; knight cards, which allow the player to move the robber as if they had rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); monopoly cards, which allow the player to steal all of any one resource from other players; road building cards, which allow the player to build two roads without paying extra resource cards; and year of plenty cards which allow the player to pick up two resource cards of their choice.


Three players in a game of Catan
Teuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land.[11] Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, Entdecker and Löwenherz. The game's first expansion, Catan: Seafarers, adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as ""New Shores"") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions.[6]

In 2020, the Board Game Analysis blog created a mathematical model to evaluate how balanced any particular board layout is, with scores ranging from 0 to 1 and lower scores being more balanced. According to that model, the beginner layout recommended in the game's manual has a balance score of 0.094. They also analyzed a board layout used in a 2016 tournament, which scored a 0.106. A sample of 100 million randomly generated board layouts formed an approximately normal distribution with the majority of boards' scores clustered around 0.25",1995,7.351045608520508

H109,"Dungeons & Dragons is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game.[24] Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting.[24] When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a ""party"" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole.[25][26] During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game.[7] This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics, and imagination.[27] A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a ""campaign"".[7][28][29]

The results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules.[29][30] The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions.[7][25] Encounters often take the form of battles with ""monsters"" – a generic term used in D&D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures.[29] In addition to jewels and gold coins, magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon.[31] Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest.[32] The game's extensive rules – which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions,[30] magic use,[33] combat,[30] and the effect of the environment on PCs[34] – help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules[30] or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.[35]

The most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks: The Player's Handbook, the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Monster Manual.[21]

The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures, and various campaign settings.[21][25]",1974,10.0
H110,"Each type of chess piece has its own method of movement. A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.[8]

Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square. The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.[a] The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).

The king moves exactly one square adjacent to it. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).
A rook moves any number of vacant squares horizontally or vertically. It also is moved when castling.
A bishop moves any number of vacant squares diagonally. (Thus a bishop can move to only light or dark squares, not both.)
The queen moves any number of vacant squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an ""L"" pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.
Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.
A pawn, unlike other pieces, captures differently from how it moves. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn. It cannot move to those squares when vacant except when capturing en passant.
The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.[10]",1501,6.6612772941589355
H111,"Set-up

Ashtāpada, an uncheckered 8×8 board, sometimes with special markings, on which chaturanga was played
Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called ashtāpada,[13] which is also the name of a game. The board sometimes had special markings, the meaning of which are unknown today.[when?] These marks were not related to chaturanga, but were drawn on the board only by tradition. These special markings coincide with squares unreachable by any of the four gajas that start on the board due to movement rules. Chess historian H. J. R. Murray conjectured that the ashtāpada was also used for some old race-type dice game, perhaps similar to chowka bhara, in which the marks had meaning.

Rules
The initial position is as shown. White moves first. The objective in chaturanga is for one side (say 'white') to checkmate the opponent's raja (king) or to reduce the other side (say 'black') to just the raja ('bare king'), although if on the following move the black side can also reduce the white side to 'bare king', in which case the game is drawn.[14]. Pieces and their moves

        aśva (horse; knight)
        padàti, bhata, or sainika (foot-soldier or infantry; pawn)
Raja (king): moves one step in any direction (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), the same as the king in chess. There is no castling in chaturanga.
The general in Chinese xiangqi lacks diagonals, which might be the earliest move of the raja. The minority view that chaturanga developed from a form of xiangqi implies such an evolution, but it is also logical to assume such a move as the case for an Indian proto-chaturanga.
Mantri (minister); also known as senapati (general): moves one step diagonally in any direction, like the fers in shatranj.
Ratha (chariot) (also known as sakaṭa) moves the same as a rook in chess: horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares.
Gaja (elephant) (also known as hasti). Three different moves are described in ancient literature:
Two squares in any diagonal direction, jumping over the first square, as the alfil in Iranian shatranj, Ethiopian senterej, Mongolian Tamerlane chess and medieval courier chess. This is a fairy chess piece that is a (2,2)-leaper.
The same move is used for the boat in Indian chaturaji, a four-player version of chaturanga.[16]
The elephant in Chinese xiangqi has the same move, but is not able to jump over an intervening piece or pawn.
The elephant in Korean janggi has the same move, but outward from an initial orthogonal step, also without the ability to jump over an intervening piece or pawn.
One step forward or one step in any diagonal direction.
The same move is used for the khon (nobleman) in Thai makruk and the sin (elephant) in Burmese sittuyin, as well as for the silver general in Japanese shogi.
The move was described c. 1030 by Biruni in his book India.
Two squares in any orthogonal (vertical or horizontal) direction, jumping over the first square; raising the questions of whether the one step forward or one step in any orthogonal direction move for the gold general in Japanese shogi is a Japanese invention and whether the camel’s (1,3) move is, according to tradition, Tamerlane’s invention.
A piece with such a move is called a dabbābah[17] in some chess variants. The move was described by the Arabic chess master al-Adli[18][19][20][21] c. 840 in his (partly lost) chess work. (The Arabic word dabbāba in former times meant a covered siege engine for attacking walled fortifications; today it means ""army tank"".)
This is reminiscent of the aforementioned chaturaji, where the elephant moves as a rook.
The German historian Johannes Kohtz (1843–1918) suggests, rather, that this was the earliest move of the Ratha.
Ashva (horse): moves the same as a knight in chess.
Padati or Bhata (foot-soldier or infantry); also known as sainika (warrior): moves and captures the same as a pawn in chess, but without a double-step option on the first move.[22]
Additional rules
Al-Adli mentions two further rules:

Stalemate was a win for a stalemated player. This rule appeared again in some medieval chess variants in England c. 1600. According to some sources, there was no stalemate, as the king is forced to move and consequently be captured.[23]
The player that is first to bare the opponent's king (i.e. capture all enemy pieces except the king) wins. In shatranj this is also a win, but only if the opponent cannot bare the player's king on his next turn.

described by equations of rigid body dynamics, specifically the theory of rotating rigid bodies. Because of the small contact area
between the tip and the underlying surface and the large rotational inertia of its body, a top that is started on a hard surface will usually
keep spinning for tens of seconds or more, even without additional energy input. Typically, the top will wobble until friction and
torque between the tip and the underlying surface force it to spin with the axis steady and upright. The total spinning time of a top
is generally increased by increasing its moment of inertia and lowering its center of gravity.",-3500,10.0
H122,"Usually, a series of boxes that are connected with each other is drawn with the first three boxes being single followed by two connected boxes and one single box, with the last two boxes connected. The boxes look like a series of three boxes stacked on top of each other (The Top Section), which is stacked on two boxes placed touching each other that are stacked on a single box (The Middle Section) which are stacked on the bottom section of two touching boxes (The Bottom Section). The person to pass through each boxes through hopping and walking with eyes closed without touching the borders is the winner. There are different levels the player has to pass through in order to become the ultimate winner.

Usually a group of players of up to 4 players (although there can be any number of players involved) decides by playing Saa-boo-Three on who should start first. The first player throws the rubble in the 1st box, without touching the corners and has to hop directly from the start line to Box 2 without touching the first box and has to hop from Box 2 to Box 8, not spending more than 10 seconds in each box and has to repeat the process in reverse, where he collects the rubble in the first box only with one hand and jumping straight to the starting point. the person who does this step without any fumbles is eligible to the next box. This time the rubble has to be thrown at the 2nd Box and repeat the process again but he is allowed to hop on Box 1 and stay as long as he wants (although most won't take more 15 seconds) as he has conquered that box. The Process goes on until he conquers all eight boxes. However, a person is out if he touches edges of any box in his attempt or he throws the rubble in other boxes than the one which he is supposed to throw. The Players take turn until a winner is emerged. There is high possibility for a person to win without other players getting turn.",-3500,10.0
H123,"The game is played in four innings (turns), with each inning lasting for seven minutes, and the teams alternating attacking and defending roles in each inning. Before each inning, the defensive team places one player in each of the trenches. A batch of four players on the attacking team,[23] who are referred to as ""assailants"", line up at one end of the court, in the area in front of the front trench. The goal of the assailants is to score by crossing each trench without being eliminated; the total number of points scored in an inning by the attacking team is equal to the number of trenches crossed by their furthest-advancing assailant.[18] If an assailant is touched by a defender (and the defender commits no faults, such as stepping out of their trench, or lifting a foot at or immediately after the time of tagging the assailant), then the assailant is ""out"", and must leave the court.[24][25] The assailant is also out if they step out of the field while failing to keep any part of their body grounded within the field.

If an assailant crosses all nine trenches, they may say the word ""Tond"", which compels the defenders to turn around, allowing the assailant to now attempt to re-cross the nine trenches in the opposite direction.[26] If an assailant manages to cross all nine trenches in both directions, a ""Lona"" is said to have been scored, meaning that 18 points have been scored by the attacking team for the 18 times that assailant crossed a trench;[18] after a Lona has been scored, the not-out assailants are brought back to the starting area and then allowed to continue scoring for the remainder of the inning.[26][15]

H124,"A match consists of three games. The team that wins two out of three games is the match winner. The team first scoring the 34th point wins a game. Teams start each game from the side opposite the one they played the previous game. There is a break of two minutes between the end of the first game and the start of the second game, and five minutes between the second and the third games. Choice of side and the right of first service is decided by a coin toss at the beginning of a match. If the team winning the toss chooses to serve, the other team has the choice of side and vice versa. At the beginning of a match the referee allows two trials, one from each side. After the trials are over, the umpire shall call ""play"" and regular play begins. A ball is in play from the time a player attempts to serve until it touches the ground or until a ""fault"" or ""let"" (a re-serve) is called by the umpire.

The officiating team consists of one umpire, two or more line referees and a scorer. When the umpire calls ""play"", if a team refuses to play it forfeits the match. The umpire is the sole judge on the fairness of a play, weather and lighting conditions. His decisions are final. It is the umpire's responsibility to call ""fault"" or ""let"", with (or without) an appeal from the players. If an umpire erroneously calls ""fault"" and immediately corrects himself and calls ""play"" but the striker fails to return the ball, a ""let"" is allowed. Umpires serve for an entire match, unless a change is authorized by the tournament committee. Each of the two (or more) line referees is responsible for one boundary line and one half of the side line opposite the umpire, in addition to any other duties assigned by the umpire. Referees signal the umpire in a code prescribed by the BBF. The scorer records the points scored and the number of hands on the score sheet. A ball may be replaced by an umpire if it is lost or damaged. The umpire can overrule a line referee's decision, if he feels that an error has been committed.

The umpire is also responsible for the net. He announces the score (for the benefit of the scorer) when a point is scored or a server is out. In announcing the score he calls the number of the serving hand, followed by the score of the serving team and the score of the other team. If a match is suspended by the umpire for any reason (e.g. weather and light), it is resumed from the point at which it was stopped. In case of a tie between two or more teams in any tournament, a match is not replayed. If the tie is unbroken, teams are ranked based on game and point scores.

H126,"At the start of play, the active chaser starts off in one of the free zones, and can run into either half of the court to tag the three defenders. Once all three defenders have been tagged out or otherwise ""dismissed"", the next ""batch"" of three defenders comes onto the court.[28]

The active chaser can switch roles with a sitting teammate by touching them on the back and shouting ""kho""; this is known as the active chaser ""giving a kho"" to the sitting teammate. One kho must be given by the active chaser upon the dismissal of a batch before the chasing team can tag any players in the next batch.[5] For the kho to be valid, it must be given before the active chaser has gone past the cross lane that the teammate is sitting within, with the sitting teammate not moving/rising before receiving the kho. Once a sitting chaser becomes active, they may only enter the half of the court which they were facing while they were sitting; additionally, once the newly active chaser steps to the left or right of the cross lane they were sitting in (or turns in such a way that their shoulders face towards either pole), they must continue in that direction until they have reached the free zone. Also, once the newly active chaser steps out of the central lane, they cannot step back into the central lane while tagging a defender.[28]

Violating any of these rules results in a ""foul"", in which case the chasing team can no longer attempt to tag any defenders. In order to clear the foul, the active chaser must move in the opposite direction of the one they were running in (i.e. away from the defenders they were chasing) until they have either given a kho to a teammate, or reached the appropriate free zone.[28]

The chasing team scores points each time a defender is ruled ""out"" (dismissed), which happens either when a chaser tags a defender without breaking any rules, when a defender steps out of the court (with no part of the body remaining grounded within), or when a defender is late to enter the court as part of a new batch after the dismissal of the previous batch.[28][29]

In the case of a tie, some matches have a tiebreaker known as a ""minimum chase"", in which each team is allotted an additional turn to score.

H132,"Each player's objective is to move all four of their pieces completely around the board, counter-clockwise, before their opponents do. The pieces start and finish on the Charkoni.

The playing order is decided by each player throwing the cowries. The player with the highest score starts, and turns continue counter-clockwise around the board. In some versions, each player throws the cowrie shells and pieces cannot move until a 2, 3, or 4 is thrown.

If a 6, 10, or 25 is thrown, the player gets a grace, which enables the player to introduce one of their pieces from the Charkoni onto the board. The player then repeats their turn. In other versions, this includes 10, 25, or 35 to introduce another of their pieces. The newly introduced pawn will be landed on square number 1, which is the very first square for every respective player: here, it is said that on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you will introduce your new pawn at square number 1, and then you will add the second throw numbers that will be appeared on your cowries and 7, 14 as a grace without the introduction of pieces (here, it should be clear to players that on throwing 7 or 14, you can not introduce your new pawn, you only get an extra turn). A player needs to have at least one piece on the board to be able to throw a 7 or 14.

Simply put, on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you can not introduce your new pawn directly to 10 or 25, or 35 number square directly, you have to land the new pawn on square number 1 and then add your remaining numbers. Once your all pawns have entered the game, throwing 10 or 25, or 35 allows you to move the respective numbers ahead.

Each player's first piece may leave the Charkoni on any throw after it has been introduced onto the board. Each player moves their pieces down the centre column of their own arm of the board, then counter-clockwise around the outside columns.

A player may have any number of pieces on the board at one time. Only one piece may be moved with a single throw, or if the player chooses, they can decline to move any piece on a throw. In some versions, a player can move any number of their pieces with a single throw. Also, if the player casts a value higher than they are eligible to move in a single throw, then the player automatically loses that turn.

More than one piece of the same team may occupy a single square (not true for all squares in some versions). However, a piece may not move onto a castle square that is already occupied by an opponent's piece.

If a piece lands on a square (other than a castle square) occupied by any number of the opponent's pieces, those pieces are captured/killed and must return to the Charkoni. Captured pieces may only enter the game again with a grace throw. A player making a capture is allowed another turn (not true in some versions).

In some versions, a player cannot take their pieces back to the Charkoni/home, unless they have captured/killed at least one of the opponent's pieces. Some versions have a rule where if, for example, two players are playing against each other, and Player 1 captures a piece of Player 2, then Player 2, in their immediate turn after being captured for the first time, captures the same piece Player 1 just used to capture, in the same square where the capture took place, then Player 1's capture/kill is invalidated. Player 1 will need to recapture Player 2's piece again to be able to go back to the Charkoni, but Player 2 is free to go ahead to their respective Charkoni unless the above repeats.

A piece completes its trip around the board by moving back up its central column. Returning pieces may be placed on their side in order to distinguish them from pieces that have just entered. A piece can only return to the Charkoni by a direct throw.

Four of the castle squares are placed so they are exactly 25 moves from the Charkoni. A common strategy is for returning pieces to stay on these squares, where they are safe from capture until a 25 is thrown. The pieces can then finish the game directly. This is where the name of the game comes from.

In some versions, where more emphasis is put on the throwing of the cowries, experienced players can cause cowries to land in a specific way, so there are certain other rules to make the game more exciting.

If a player has their pieces closer to the end, and does not need a higher value throw, there are ways to nullify the higher value throw.
If the player casts a 10, 25, or 30, the player needs to consecutively throw either 10, 25, or 30 three times (including the original throw) to nullify the higher value throw.
If the player casts a 7, the player must consecutively cast a 7 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
If the player casts a 14, the player must consecutively cast a 14 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
Since throwing three consecutive throws of 10, 25, or 30 in a single turn nullifies them, players can instead throw a 7 or 14 in between to keep their turn going. EX: A player can throw the following in a single turn: 25, 25, 14, 10, 30, 7, 25, 30, 7, 10, 14, 25, 3.
Once all of the player's pieces are introduced onto the board, every time a player throws a 10, 25, or 30, the player must move their piece one additional square, which is known as PYADA. EX: A player casts 25, 25, 3 in their turn, and their pieces can move a total of 53 squares. However, when all the player's pieces have already been introduced onto the board, the player can then move a total of 55 squares (25+25+3+1+1), meaning 2 pyadas extra.",1860,6.496546268463135

The player representing the goat must wait till all 15 game pieces representing goats have been placed on the board. The movement of the pieces should be along the lines and one place at a time.

As the tiger can move first, it is imperative for the player representing the goats to place the game pieces with care. The game involves concentration, skill and strategic thinking. The key aspect that distinguishes hunt games from others is that they are asymmetrical. The two sides neither have the same number of game pieces and moves, nor the same aims. And yet, they are equally balanced. In this game, one player has three tigers and the other 15 goats. The aim of the tiger is to kill the goats and the aim of the goats to surround the tigers so they cannot move. The tigers kill by jumping over a goat, while a goat cannot jump at all.

For the counters in the game, seeds, shells, small stones are all common for use.[7] As the game proceeds, each player distributes the shells over all the pits. The players may capture the shells, as permitted by the rules of the game. The rules of capture depend on the variant of the game played. The game ends when one of the players captures all the shells, and is declared as a winner.

12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction.

If, after having a counter dropped into it, a cup contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped the counter (pasu in Tamil). The round is over when no counters remain.

Once the first round is over players take the counters from their stores and fill as many of their holes as possible with counters.

The vertical lines are known as files (Chinese: 路; pinyin: lù; lit. 'road'), and the horizontal lines are known as ranks (Chinese: 線/綫; pinyin: xiàn; lit. 'line').

Centred at the first to third and eighth to tenth ranks of the board are two zones, each three points by three points, demarcated by two diagonal lines connecting opposite corners and intersecting at the centre point. Each of these areas is known as 宮 gōngⓘ, a palace.

Dividing the two opposing sides, between the fifth and sixth ranks, is 河 hé, the ""river"". The river is usually marked with the phrases 楚河 chǔ héⓘ, meaning ""River of the Chu"", and 漢界 hàn jièⓘ, meaning ""Border of the Han"", a reference to the Chu–Han War. Although the river (or Hanchu boundary) provides a visual division between the two sides, only two pieces are affected by its presence: soldiers have an enhanced move after crossing the river, and elephants cannot cross it. The starting points of the soldiers and cannons are usually, but not always, marked with small crosses.

The pieces start in the position shown in the diagram above. Which player moves first has varied throughout history and from one part of China to another. Different xiangqi books advise either that the black or red side moves first.[citation needed] Some books refer to the two sides as north and south; which direction corresponds to which colour also varies from source to source. Generally, Red moves first in most modern tournaments.[1]

Each player in turn moves one piece from the point it occupies, to another point. Pieces are generally not permitted to move through points occupied by other pieces, the exception being the cannon’s capturing move. A piece can be moved onto a point occupied by an enemy piece, in which case the enemy piece is captured and removed from the board. A player cannot capture one of their own pieces. Pieces are never promoted (converted into other pieces), although the soldier gains the ability to move sideways after it crosses the river. Almost all pieces capture using their normal moves, while the cannon has a special capture move described below.


An instance of checkmate that assumes the cannon is safe and Black cannot block the check. The horse is not needed for this checkmate.
The game ends when one player checkmates the other's general. When the general is in danger of being captured by the enemy player on their next move, the enemy player has ""delivered a check"" (照將/將軍, abbreviated as 將 jiāngⓘ), and the general is ""in check"". A check should be announced. If the general's player can make no move to prevent the general's capture, the situation is called ""checkmate"" (將死). Unlike in chess, in which stalemate is a draw, in xiangqi, it is a loss for the stalemated player.

In xiangqi, a player—often with a material or positional disadvantage—may attempt to check or chase pieces in a way such that the moves fall in a cycle, preventing the opponent from winning. While this is accepted in Western chess, in xiangqi, the following special rules are used to make it harder to draw the game by endless checking or chasing, regardless of whether the positions of the pieces are repeated or not:

Perpetual checks with one piece or several pieces are not allowed; doing so results in a loss.
Perpetual chases of any one unprotected piece with one or more pieces, excluding generals and soldiers, are similarly prohibited.[2]
If one side perpetually checks and the other side perpetually chases, the checking side has to stop or be ruled to have lost.
When neither side violates the rules and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.
When both sides violate the same rule at the same time (note that unlike in western chess, a mutual perpetual check is possible) and both persist in not making an alternate move, the game can be ruled as a draw.
Mutual perpetual check

A mutual perpetual check occurs with (see #Notation below for notation) 1.Hd7+ Hf4+ 2.Ae2+ Hh3+ 3.Af3+ Hf4+ 4.Ae2+ etc.
Different sets of rules set different limits on what is considered perpetual. For example, club xiangqi rules allow a player to check or chase six consecutive times using one piece, twelve times using two pieces, and eighteen times using three pieces before considering the action perpetual.[2]

The above rules to prevent perpetual checking and chasing, while popular, are not the only ones; there are numerous end game situations.[3]",548,7.810707092285156
H150,"Go is an adversarial game between two players with the objective of capturing territory. That is, occupying and surrounding a larger total empty area of the board with one's stones than the opponent.[21] As the game progresses, the players place stones on the board creating stone ""formations"" and enclosing spaces. Once placed, stones are never moved on the board, but when ""captured"" are removed from the board. Stones are linked together into a formation by being adjacent along the black lines, not on diagonals (of which there are none). Contests between opposing formations are often extremely complex and may result in the expansion, reduction, or wholesale capture and loss of formations and their enclosed empty spaces (called ""eyes""). Another essential component of the game is control of the sente (that is, controlling the offense, so that one's opponent is forced into defensive moves); this usually changes several times during play.


The illustration [A] displays the four ""liberties"" (adjacent empty points) of a single black stone. Illustrations [B], [C], and [D] show White reducing those liberties progressively by one. In [D], when Black has only one liberty left, that stone is under attack and about to be captured and eliminated (a state called atari).[22] White may capture that stone (remove it from the board) with a play on its last liberty (at D-1).
Initially the board is bare, and players alternate turns to place one stone per turn. As the game proceeds, players try to link their stones together into ""living"" formations (meaning that they are permanently safe from capture), as well as threaten to capture their opponent's stones and formations. Stones have both offensive and defensive characteristics, depending on the situation.

An essential concept is that a formation of stones must have, or be capable of making, at least two enclosed open points known as eyes to preserve itself from being captured. A formation having at least two eyes cannot be captured, even after it is surrounded by the opponent on the outside,[23] because each eye constitutes a liberty that must be filled by the opponent as the final step in capture. A formation having two or more eyes is said to be unconditionally alive,[24] so it can evade capture indefinitely, and a group that cannot form two eyes is said to be dead and can be captured.

The general strategy is to place stones to fence-off territory, attack the opponent's weak groups (trying to kill them so they will be removed), and always stay mindful of the life status of one's own groups.[25][26] The liberties of groups are countable. Situations where mutually opposing groups must capture each other or die are called capturing races, or semeai.[27] In a capturing race, the group with more liberties will ultimately be able to capture the opponent's stones.[27][28][b] Capturing races and the elements of life or death are the primary challenges of Go.

In the end game players may pass rather than place a stone if they think there are no further opportunities for profitable play.[29] The game ends when both players pass[30] or when one player resigns. In general, to score the game, each player counts the number of unoccupied points surrounded by their stones and then subtracts the number of stones that were captured by the opponent. The player with the greater score (after adjusting for handicapping called komi) wins the game.

In the opening stages of the game, players typically establish groups of stones (or bases) near the corners and around the sides of the board, usually starting on the third or fourth line in from the board edge rather than at the very edge of the board. The edges and corners make it easier to develop groups which have better options for life (self-viability for a group of stones that prevents capture) and establish formations for potential territory.[31] Players usually start near the corners because establishing territory is easier with the aid of two edges of the board.[32] Established corner opening sequences are called joseki and are often studied independently.[33] However, in the mid-game, stone groups must also reach in towards the large central area of the board to capture more territory.

Dame are points that lie in between the boundary walls of black and white, and as such are considered to be of no value to either side. Seki are mutually alive pairs of white and black groups where neither has two eyes.

Ko (Chinese and Japanese: 劫) is a potentially indefinitely repeated stone-capture position. The rules do not allow a board position to be repeated. Therefore, any move which would restore the previous board position would not be allowed, and the next player would be forced to play somewhere else. If the play requires a strategic response by the first player, further changing the board, then the second player could ""retake the ko,"" and the first player would be in the same situation of needing to change the board before trying to take the ko back. And so on.[34] Some of these ko fights may be important and decide the life of a large group, while others may be worth just one or two points. Some ko fights are referred to as picnic kos when only one side has a lot to lose.[35] In Japanese, it is called a hanami ko.[36]

Playing with others usually requires a knowledge of each player's strength, indicated by the player's rank (increasing from 30 kyu to 1 kyu, then 1 dan to 7 dan, then 1 dan pro to 9 dan pro). A difference in rank may be compensated by a handicap—Black is allowed to place two or more stones on the board to compensate for White's greater strength.[37][38] There are different rulesets (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, AGA, etc.), which are almost entirely equivalent, except for certain special-case positions and the method of scoring at the end.",-2852,7.664618015289307
H151,"Each player in turn, in counter-clockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out the win (each region does this call differently—no Asian version uses the word ""mahjong"" to signal a win) while revealing their hand.

There are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:

A bonus tile (flower or season) is drawn
A meld (pung, kong, or chow) is made from a discard
Going mahjong (declaring a winning hand)
Robbing a kong
During play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any bonus tiles (flowers and seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.

H153,"The general concept of kendama is pulling the ken up and balancing the tama somewhere on the ken, or vice versa. There are not any specific rules on how to play kendama. However, bending the knees while playing kendama is a method that experts use.[4] Endless tricks and trick combinations can be made with just ken grip, sara grip, tama grip, and candle grip by themselves or together in a combination. Some examples of tricks in each of these grips are as follows:

Ken grip
Spike: This trick involves the hole in the tama and the spike.

Hold the ken with the spike pointing straight up
Hold the ball with the off hand to ensure the ball is still before starting the motion of this trick
Bend the knees
Pull the tama up with the entire body
Catch the ball in the spike by directing the spike underneath the hole in the tama[5]
Swing Spike: a variation of the Spike.

Hold the ken in a way similar to preparing a spike
Hold the ball with the opposite hand and slightly bring it back towards the body, keeping the tension in the string
Let go of the ball and swing the ball out in front of self
Tug the string a bit to make the ball rotate the hole 360° towards self
Catch the tama on the spike by connecting the spike and the hole together.[6]
Around Japan: This trick is a combination of the big cup, small cup, and the spike.

Pull the ball up into the small cup
Hop the ball over to the big cup by rotating the wrist to the right (and vice versa if left handed)
Keep an eye on the hole, and hop the ball up onto the spike, connecting the hole and spike together[7]

H154,"Each player's nine Pawns are placed on the third nearest row to the player. The Rook and the Bishop are placed on the second row one space in from the edge, the Rook on the right, the Bishop on the left. The remaining pieces are placed on the row nearest to the player in the following way: the Lances in each corner, the Knights on the next square in from the corner, the Silver Generals next to the Knights. The middle square on the nearest row holds the King with the Gold Generals either side of him.

The objective of Japanese Chess is to capture the opposing player's King. The King is never actually taken; instead the aim is put the opponent's King into a position such that the opposing player can do nothing to avoid the King being taken next turn. As soon as this happens, the victorious player who has just moved says ""checkmate"" and the game is over.

Basic Play for Shogi
Players take turns to move a piece that belongs to them. Each piece is moved according to different rules but no two pieces can occupy the same square. If a piece moves so that its final position is a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is ""captured"" or ""taken"" and is removed from the board. Captured pieces should be placed face up within easy view of both players. It is not compulsory to capture.


King - moves one space in any direction diagonally or orthogonally EXCEPT that the King cannot move onto a square that is attacked by an opposing piece.

Gold General - moves one space in one of 6 directions - forwards, diagonally forwards, sideways or backwards.

Silver General - moves one space in one of 5 directions - forwards, diagonally forwards or diagonally backwards.

Knight - moves two squares forwards and then one square sideways. Only two squares are available to the Knight but, in compensation, it is the only piece that can jump over other pieces.

Lance - moves any number of spaces forwards.

Rook - moves any number of spaces orthogonally but cannot jump over another piece.

Bishop - moves any number of spaces diagonally but cannot jump over another piece.

Pawn - moves one square forwards only.",794,7.169951438903809
H155,"The game is played between two partners or two teams who play in turns, sometimes it is played with more teams. There is no limit in the number of participants in a game, which means that the game can be played by a considerable group. When played with large groups it is not uncommon for some group members never to cast the sticks: they still participate by discussing the strategy.

The start of the game is determined by each team casting the yut-sticks. The team with the highest score starts first.

Each team then casts the sticks in turn, then moves a mal according to the score achieved. One turn usually consists of only one cast. However, a player achieving a yut or mo earns an extra cast for the turn; if the player casts a yut or mo at the second cast, they earn an extra cast again, so there is no limit to the number of times a player can cast again before the end of a turn, provided they keep casting yuts or mos. The respective scores can be played separately if wished, each given to another mal (or group of mals, see below), but a score earned from one cast cannot be split into two moves—for example, a geol (advance three steps) cannot be split into a do (one step) and a gae (two steps).


The four possible courses of the game of Yut
As long as there are mals outside the board, a team can either put a new mal onto the board according to the scores it got, or move a mal already on the board. The mals travel around the board and can move forward only. However, when landing on one of the big stations (in the corner and the centre), the team can choose to take the shorter way should they wish to. There are four possible courses, the default course being longest one with no abbreviation (No. 4).

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the opponent's team, the opponent's mal is removed from the course and returned to the starting position, and the current player is allowed to cast again.

If a mal lands on a station occupied by the own team, these mals can form a group and travel together from that point on.  However, this bears a risk: If an opponent lands their mal on a station occupied by a group of mals of the opponent, all mals in the group are removed from the course.

For example, if one casts two yuts and one do at their first turn in the game, possible moves would include (see The Stations below for the station names):

Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut score); advance to mo (uses the do score), then to sok-yut (uses the second yut).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses first yut score); put another mal on the board at the same yut station (uses the second yut score), causing the two mals to move together from then on; advance them to mo (uses the do).
Put a mal on the board at the yut station (uses the first yut); advance to duet-geol (uses the second yut), then to duet-yut (uses the do).
The game is won by the team who brings all their mals home first, that is complete the course with all their mals. A course is completed if a mal passes the station where the game is started (cham-meoki). Landing on cham-meoki is no finish, but any score going ""beyond"" this station completes a home run. Yut is often played for three or more wins",-57,7.643118858337402
H156,"Ssireum is conducted within a circular ring, measuring approximately 7 meters in diameter, which is covered with mounded sand. The two contestants begin the match by kneeling on the sand in a grappling position (baro japki), each grabbing a belt—known as a satba (샅바)[10]—which is wrapped around his opponent's waist and thigh. The wrestlers then rise while retaining their hold on the other's 'satba.' The match is awarded to the wrestler who forces the other contestant to touch the ground with any part of his body at knee level or higher. Unlike sumo, pushing an opponent outside of the ring does not warrant a win, just a restart. Normally, professional ssireum is contested in a best-out-of-three style match.

There are three judges, a chief referee and three sub referees. The chief judge is positioned inside the ring, whereas the sub referees are located on the outside of the ring, one to the right and others to the left. If an unfair judgment is called or the chief referee is unable to render a decision, the sub referees can request a revocation of the decision or a rematch. In addition, they can recommend the cessation of the match when an injury occurs. The referees' decisions throughout the competition are absolute and held in the highest regard, meaning that athletes cannot challenge any judgments declared during the match.

Today there are also women ssireum wrestlers. Women wrestle only among themselves but follow the same rules (except that men are topless whereas women wear tops).

There are four weight classes in professional wrestling: flyweight (Taebaek, 75 kg), lightweight (Geumgang, 90 kg), middleweight (Halla, 105 kg), and heavyweight (Baekdu, under 160 kg), named after the four famous peaks in Korea.[11]

Traditionally ssireum was contested with the top portion of the trousers rolled down to provide grip. The use of ""satba"" was invented with the birth of professional ssireum in the mid-20th century. There is a movement to restore this traditional method of grip, in the spirit of maintaining its cultural and traditional roots, but it has met with some resistance as the use of ""satba"" has become entrenched in the modern form.

The professional league is dwindling in popularity and many wrestlers have turned their attention to mixed martial arts fighting, even though ssireum involves no striking or submissions of any kind, as a means of making a living. Choi Hong-man, former champion of ssireum, enjoyed notable success in the K-1 scene. Unfortunately, the future of professional ssireum remains bleak, with only one team remaining. However, it can also be argued that ssireum is beginning to undergo global expansion as a popular martial arts sport, alongside taekwondo and hapkido.

It is important to note the differences between ssireum and sumo. Ssireum has remained largely a national/traditional sport. Physical hits such as slaps and blows are not permitted in ssireum, though they are in sumo. In both sports, the competitors are often quite large, though Korean wrestlers tend to be leaner. However, size does not guarantee success in either sport. Although both sports are quite similar, they differ in characteristics as well as values.

The national governing body of the sport in Korea, Korean Ssireum Organisation, has made a claim that ssireum is characterised as a ""peaceful competition focusing on harmony and unison"", reflecting the ""philosophical outlook of the Koreans""",-37,10.0

Moves exactly the same as the king in western chess: one space in any direction. He does not have the power to castle.	move of the king 'khun' or lord in makruk (Thai chess)

Queen — “Met” — Seed
Moves only one space diagonally. This is the move of the piece in the queen’s place, found in most ancient forms of chess.	move of the queen 'met' or seed in makruk (Thai chess)
Bishop — “Khon” — Nobleman
Moves one space diagonally or one space forward. This move is found in Japanese chess, and in other chess variants of Southeast Asia.	move of the bishop 'khon' or nobleman in makruk (Thai chess)
Knight — “Ma” — Horse
Moves two spaces forward, backward, right or left, plus one space at a right angle. This is the only piece allowed to jump over any intervening piece in its path. It has exactly the same move as the knight in western chess.	move of the knight 'ma' or horse in makruk (Thai chess)
Rook — “Rua” — Boat
Moves as many spaces as desired forward, backward, right or left. Can not leap over any pieces. This move is exactly the same as that of the western rook.	move of the rook 'rua' or boat in makruk (Thai chess)
Pawn — “Bia” — Cowry Shell
When moving normally, this piece moves one step forward; but it captures by moving one step forward-diagonally. Exactly like the western pawn, but with no power to move two spaces on its first move.	move of the pawn 'bia' or cowry shell in makruk (Thai chess)

Promoted Pawn — “Biagai” — (Promoted Cowry)

When the pawn reaches the 6th row (i.e., the opponent’s 3rd row), it is flipped over and its move is changed to the move of the queen (met): one space in any diagonal direction.	move of the promoted pawn 'biagai'  in makruk (Thai chess)
a sample line-up of Thai chessmen

Did you notice that the king, queen and bishop are essentially the same shape, but different in size? Even the rook is similar, but a more squat figure. It may be confusing at first, but you will get used to distinguishing them.

Captures

All pieces capture by moving onto the square of an enemy piece and removing that piece from the board. Only the pawn has a special move for capturing; all others use their normal moves to capture.

Check and Checkmate

When a player’s king is threatened with capture (in check), he must move in such a way that the king is no longer threatened. If he can not, he is in checkmate, and the game is lost. If, however, the player finds that any move he makes will put his king in check, but he in not in check at the moment, this is a stalemate, and the game is a draw.

Drawn Games

Many games of makruk end in draws, and this is because of special rules in the endgame which permit the disadvantaged player to claim a draw in very peculiar, and sometimes rather complex, ways. The back panel of this brochure explains the special drawn game rules.

Special Drawn Game Rules

When you find yourself with a less powerful group of pieces than your opponent, there are two special rules which may draw the game:

I. The Board’s Honor Rule

If there are no unpromoted pawns on the board, and you are at a distinct disadvantage, you may begin counting your moves aloud up to 64 (the number of squares on the board). If you are able to make the 65th move and you haven’t been checkmated, the game is a draw.

II. The Pieces’ Honor Rule

Watch for the situation in which (1) you have a lone king with no remaining pieces and, at the same time (2) there are no unpromoted pawns on the board. At that moment (when your last piece is taken, or your opponent’s last pawn is promoted), you must stop and do some figuring. Follow this system carefully, and you may be able to claim a draw.

1. Find the move count number in this way. First ask,
(1) Does the opponent have 2 rooks? If so, the number is 8.
If not, go to the next question:
(2) Does he have 1 rook? If so the number is 16.
Continue to ask, in this order, until you get an affirmative answer:
(3) 2 bishops? If so, it’s 22; (4) 2 knights? If so, it’s 32;
(5) 1 bishop? If so, it’s 44; (6) any pieces at all? If so, it’s 64.

2. Now that you have the move count number, count all of the pieces on the board, including all of your opponents pieces, his king and your king. For instance if he has 1 rook, 2 bishops, 2 promoted pawns and a king, against your lone king, you count up to 7. (In this example the move count number is 16.)

3. Now, as you make your move (finally, after all that calculating), begin counting from where you left off. In the example above, your move will be counted “8.” You continue to count all of your own moves (in this example, ...9, 10, 11…) up to the move count number (in this example ...16). If you reach the move count number without being checkmated, your opponent has one final move to deliver checkmate. If he can not — congratulations — you’ve drawn the game!

H174,"The board is an oval with five squares per side and, in addition, a bigger one at each end. The small squares are called ""citizen squares"" (ô dân), ""ricefields"" (ruộng) or ""fishponds"" (ao ci) and the big ones ""mandarin squares"" (ô quan). The board is drawn on the ground.

Each player or team controls five farmer squares, while the mandarin squares are neutral.

Each player puts five pebbles (fruit seeds or other small objects) in each square he owns and a big stone, the ""mandarin"" (quan), on the mandarin square. The pebbles are known as dân (""people"", ""citizen"").

Initial Position

The first player is determined by oẳn tù tì (""one, two, three""), which is a Vietnamese variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

On his turn a player picks up the contents of one of his ricefields and distributes the pebbles, one by one, in either direction on the following squares (including both mandarin squares). This is called rải (""to scatter"").

He lifts the contents of the square immediately behind the last one where a pebble was dropped and keeps on distributing its contents.

However, if a mandarin square follows, the turn ends.
The move ends when the last pebble falls on a square, which is followed by an empty one.

If there are two or more empty squares, the turn passes.
If the empty square is followed by a non-empty one, he captures its contents, and if it is followed by another empty square and another non-empty one, he captures the contents of this one too, and so on. The captures are removed from the board.
A square, which contains many pieces, is called nhà giàu (""rich square""). Pebbles, which are on the Mandarin square, are known as quan non (""quan"": Mandarin; non: ""young"" / ""unripe"").

If all the ricefields of one player are empty at any time, he must put one pebble on each ricefield. These pebbles are taken from the captures. This is called ""to release the fish"" (thả cá). If on his/her side of the board are empty, he/she must use five won-pieces to place one piece down one square on his/her side and repeats the distribution. If a player doesn't have enough pebbles to fill every square, he must borrow them from the other player. At the end of the game, he must return them to his opponent.

The game ends when the two mandarin squares are empty, which is called ""fall of the mandarins"" (hết quan).

Then the remaining pieces belong to the player who owns their squares, which is expressed by the Vietnamese saying: ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, bán ruộng"" (literally: ""Mandarin doesn't exit, people disappear, getting the army out, selling the rice field."") or ""hết quan, tàn dân, thu quân, kéo về"" (literally: ""Mandarin doesn't exit, people disappear, getting the army out, coming back."").

The winner is the player who has more points. Pebbles count 1 point, mandarins 10 points.

Match Rules
Before the next game starts, the loser asks the winner to give him as many pebbles he needs to reach the number of 35. Then the players put their pebbles in their old place and the game is played again under the same conditions as previously.

If the loser asks his companion for five pebbles for example, he owes to him provisionally one square of his series. This is called ""to give provisionally a ricefield"" (cầm ruộng). At the end of the game, the pebbles that the square thus given up contains will be divided equally among the two players.

If the loser asks his opponent for ten pebbles, he must give him one of his squares definitively, which is called bán ruộng (""to sell a ricefield""). If he has lost by 20 pebbles, he must even sell two ricefields. The pebbles that remain in the sold ricefields at the end of the game are won by the new owner of the square.

In the next round it is possible to get back the sold ricefield, if the player wins by (at least) 10 pebbles.

The game continues until three or four squares of the same series are sold. The player of this series holds out his hands to the winner who beats them",1986,6.764318943023682

A player drops a shell into his 'storehouse' each time he passes it but does not deposit any into his opponent's 'storehouse'.

4.               How the game continues, depends on where the last shell of each scoop is deposited : 

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO THE PLAYER'S OWN 'STOREHOUSE': The player scoops up the shells from any of his 'houses' and distributes them in the cups ('houses') round the board but not in his opponents's 'storehouse'.

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO THE PLAYER'S 'HOUSE' WHICH IS WITHOUT SHELLS: The player is entitled to collect the shells in his opponent's 'house' directly opposite his own. These shells collected from his opponent's house together with his last shell are deposited in his own 'storehouse'. If the opponent's 'house' opposite his own is empty, he deposits only his last shell in his own 'storehouse'. He forfeits his turn and stops playing. It is the opponent's turn now to distribute the shells.

•   IF THE SHELL DROPS INTO AN EMPTY 'HOUSE' BELONGING TO THE OPPONENT: The player forfeits his turn and stops playing. He also forfeits his shell and leaves it in the opponent's 'house'. It is the opponent's turn now to distribute the shells.

H186,"A team of six players pass the ball back and forth with their feet, knees and heads as they walk around a circle. One player goes into the center to solo, creating a dance of various moves strung together. The soloist is supported by the other players who try to pass the ball back with one kick. When the ball drops to the ground it is dead, and the play starts again.

Chinlone means “basket-rounded or rounded basket ” in Burmese. The ball is woven from rattan, and makes a distinctive clicking sound when kicked that is part of the aesthetic of the game. Players use six points of contact with the ball: the top of the toes, the inner and outer sides of the foot, the sole, the heel, and the knee. The game is played barefoot or in chinlone shoes that allow the players to feel the ball and the ground as directly as possible. The typical playing circle is 6.7 metres (22 ft) in diameter. The ideal playing surface is dry, hard packed dirt, but almost any flat surface will do.

Burma is a predominantly Buddhist country, and chinlone games are a featured part of the many Buddhist festivals that take place during the year. The largest of these festivals goes on for more than a month with up to a thousand teams. An announcer calls out the names of the moves and entertains the audience with clever wordplay. Live music from a traditional orchestra inspires the players and shapes the style and rhythm of their play. The players play in time to the music and the musicians accent the kicks.

Both men and women play chinlone, often on the same team. Adults and children can play on the same team, and it is not unusual to see elders in their 80s playing.

In addition to the team style of chinlone, which is called “wein kat” or circle kick, there is also a solo performance style called ""tapandaing"". This solo style is only performed by women.

To play chinlone well, the whole team must be absolutely in the moment – their minds cannot wander or the ball will drop. All serious players experience an intensely focused state of mind, similar to that achieved in Zen meditation, which they refer to as jhana.

Chinlone is one of a family of football games played throughout the world. It is related to similar games in Southeast Asia known as takraw in Thailand, sepak raga in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, sipa in the Philippines, kator in Laos and da cau in Vietnam. A competitive variation of the game played over a net, called sepak takraw was developed in Malaysia in the 1940s. The origins of chinlone may be related to the ancient Chinese game of cuju or tsu chu, which is acknowledged by FIFA as being the oldest form of soccer. A similar game is also played in Japan where it is known as kemari. Chinlone is also related to the family of sports played by kicking a shuttlecock, known as jianzi in China and jegichagi in Korea. And there is some evidence to suggest that a variation of these games traveled across the Bering Straits and influenced Native Americans, who also played a variety of games keeping a ball up with the feet.

The catcher listens for the bleats and grapples to find the goat. In turn, the goat must move quietly to avoid being trapped. Since both players are blindfolded, the goat and goat catcher must use both their ears and wits to win.

The other players distract the goat and goat catcher to make them turn in the wrong direction. This creates hilarious moments and prolongs the game. A new round begins once the goat has been caught. Other players who want to join the game may ask to play the goat or goat catcher.",1600,7.737600803375244
H196,"Sumo bouts take place in a ring that is approximately 15 feet in diameter and is raised on a block of clay that is known as a dohyo approximately 2.5 feet above the ground.
Each Sumo bout must begin with an elaborate ceremonial ritual in which the wrestlers both perform certain actions and throw salt into the ring. Once the ritual is over, the two wrestlers face each other and wait for the referee to begin the action.
Both wrestlers are to crouch with fists on the floor until the referee signifies the start of the match.
Both fighters then engage with each other in an attempt to win the bout.
There are essentially three ways that Rikishi can attempt to win the match:
Pushing their opponent out of the ring
Grabbing their opponent’s belt and forcing them out of the ring
Forcing their opponent to the floor
A Rikishi is permitted to use any technique to try and win the match apart from:
hair pulling
punching
striking the ears
choking
attacking the groin area
As soon as one competitor has been forced out of the ring or to the floor, the match is over and the referee announces the winner as well as the technique (kimarite) that was used to win the fight.
Contestants can also lose a Sumo fight by using an illegal technique (known as kinjite) or if their belt become undone",300,6.723277568817139
