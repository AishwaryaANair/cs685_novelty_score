1 flat circular board (drawn in sand or carved into wood) divided into a sunburst pattern with 12 outer circles (like petals) and a central circle.

20 small stones per player (representing ""Lions"")

1 larger central stone (the ""Prey"")

Setup:
Each player chooses a color of stones (can be differentiated by material, markings, or shape).

The larger central ""Prey"" stone is placed in the middle circle.

Players place 5 of their Lion stones on outer circles opposite their position around the board.

Objective:
To control the central ""Prey"" stone by outmaneuvering or outlasting the other players’ Lion stones.

How to Play:
Turn-Based Movement: Players take turns moving one Lion at a time, either:

Into an adjacent circle

Or jumping over an opponent’s Lion into an empty circle beyond (capturing the jumped piece, similar to checkers)

Claiming the Prey:

If a player moves one of their Lions into the central circle, they now control the ""Prey"".

However, any Lion in the center is vulnerable to attack from all directions.

Defending the Prey:

To ""hold the prey,"" a player must keep at least 2 Lions adjacent to the center.

If another player captures the Lion in the center, they gain control.

Winning the Game:

A player wins by:

Holding the Prey stone for 3 full rounds (all players’ turns), or

Chalk (optional, for marking boundaries)
Setup:

Choose a safe open outdoor space where players can freely move around, such as a park or open field.
Designate a starting point and an area for the ""treasure"" to be hidden.

1 Jade marker (a small piece of jade, or a similarly valued stone, to represent the prize or goal)
A simple grid drawn on the ground, made up of 20 squares in a straight path (like a simplified Snakes and Ladders board without the snakes and ladders).
Objective: Be the first to reach the Jade marker and claim it, or be in the lead if multiple players reach it simultaneously.

Setup:

The Jade marker is placed at the 20th square.
Each player chooses a color (white or black) and takes their corresponding stones.
Players roll the die to determine the starting player (highest roll starts).
Rules:

Each player takes turns rolling the die and moving their stone along the path. The number rolled is the number of squares they can move their stone.
If a player lands on a square that already has an opponent's stone, the opponent's stone is returned to the start, and the turn ends for the player whose stone was displaced.
If a player rolls a six, they get an additional roll. There is no limit to the number of sixes that can be rolled consecutively.
If a player lands on the 20th square (where the Jade marker is placed), they have the opportunity to claim the Jade marker if they roll a number that would allow them to land on it again on their next turn (to symbolize the care needed to secure the prize).
To claim the Jade marker, the player must roll exactly the amount needed to land on the Jade marker square again on their next turn. If they overshoot or do not roll, their stone remains on the 20th square, but they do not claim the Jade marker yet.
If multiple players are on the 20th square and all roll successfully to claim the Jade marker, the player who does so first (during their turn sequence) claims the Jade marker.
Winning:

The first player to claim the Jade marker by rolling the exact number to land on it again and moving their stone onto the marker's square wins the game.
In case of a tie (multiple players claiming the Jade marker on the same round but in sequence), the player who rolled and claimed it first in the turn order is declared the winner.
Variation for 5 Players:

Introduce a second Jade marker (or a different valued stone) placed at square 10. This allows for an intermediate goal and can provide a strategic advantage.

L49,Olmo,"""The Emperor's Path"" is a strategy-based, storytelling, and cooperative game, played using limited equipment. It is set in medieval East Asia, with players taking on roles of officials, warriors, and scholars. Their goal is to navigate and protect the Emperor through a dangerous path to his hidden sanctuary.

Equipment Needed:

A set of small stones or pebbles (at least 50)
A large cloth or paper with a drawn map of the path (divided into 10-15 sections)
Tokens (preferably coins, shells or small carved wooden pieces) to represent the players and the Emperor
A six-sided die or a simple random number generator (handmade or improvised)
Paper and pen for scorekeeping and storytelling
Game Objective: The players must work together to guide the Emperor safely through the perilous path to the sanctuary by overcoming various challenges. They win if the Emperor reaches the sanctuary. If the Emperor is captured or defeated, all players lose.

Game Play:

Players decide on their roles: Official (good at negotiation), Warrior (good at combat), and Scholar (good at problem-solving). A fifth role, the Spy, can be added for more players, who can either help or hinder the group's efforts.

The Emperor's token starts at the beginning of the path. The other tokens start one section behind the Emperor.

Each player takes turns rolling the die to determine their action:

1-2: Encounter a challenge (draw a challenge card and negotiate or fight based on the scenario)
3-4: Protect the Emperor (move your token forward to the Emperor's position and provide defense)
5-6: Assist in Emperor's journey (move the Emperor's token forward one section)
Challenge Cards: The host (a player not playing as an official character) or any player can create challenges ahead of time on paper, such as bandit attacks, treacherous terrain, or puzzles. These can be as detailed or simple as you like.

Combat and Negotiations: In combat, the Warrior can choose to fight. They roll the die; a 4-6 is a success (more can be added for epic wins), a 1-3 is a failure. In negotiations, the Official rolls, with similar success criteria. Scholars solve riddles or puzzles, which can be solved through verbal reasoning.

Scorekeeping: Each successful challenge overcome grants the players a stone. If a player fails to protect the Emperor or fails a challenge, they lose a stone. The goal is to collect as many stones as possible by the end.

The Spy (optional): This player can secretly decide to help or hinder the group. The Spy can change the outcome of a roll by one point once per turn, but if the Spy is discovered, they must play as a regular player with a penalty (e.g., starting with fewer stones).

Storytelling: Players should narrate their actions and the consequences, building a collective story of their journey. This encourages creativity and entertainment, even with minimal equipment.

Winning the Game: The Emperor successfully reaching the sanctuary marks the end of the game. Players count their stones, with the highest scorer earning the title of ""Majestic Councilor"", but all players who helped the Emperor win are celebrated as heroes.",2025,9.821749687194824,7.0,exp_decay

Escape: Non-taggers try to retrieve the ball without getting tagged. If a non-tagger gets tagged, they sit down at the spot where they were tagged, but can still try to touch the ball when it passes close to them.
Bamboo Dodge: Non-taggers can use agility to dodge the bamboo sticks. They should also strategize to create distractions for other non-taggers to grab the ball.
Ball Retrieval: If a non-tagger retrieves the ball, they must return to the perimeter of the field without getting tagged. Once safely on the perimeter, they can choose to either attempt a throw to hit one of the Taggers (if successful, the thrower and all seated players return to the game) or keep the ball to dodge and wait for a better opportunity.
Winning: The game continues until all non-taggers are tagged and sitting down, or until one non-tagger remains untagged and has successfully returned to the perimeter with the ball multiple times as decided by the group (e.g., three successful retrievals).
Variations:

Increase the challenge by allowing Taggers to tag with their hands when they retrieve the ball from a non-tagger.
Allow Taggers to swap after every round, giving each player a turn with the bamboo stick.",2025,9.779878616333008,3.0,exp_decay
L51,Olmo,"To be the first player to move their pawn (representative of a humble villager) from the starting point to the finish line, navigating through a series of challenges inspired by ancient Indian folklore and mythology.

Equipment:

A circle drawn on the ground (a patch of dirt or a cleared space).
Small stones or pebbles (each player needs one) - these serve as the pawns.
Cowrie shells (preferably 4-5 for dice) or beans, if cowrie shells are not available.
A handful of pebbles or seeds to keep score.
Preparation:

Draw a circular board with 8 evenly spaced sections. Each section represents a different challenge (e.g., river crossing, mountain climbing, forest path, village market, etc.).
Assign each section a number of cowrie shell tosses needed for a successful challenge.
Gameplay:

Each player chooses a pebble as their pawn and places it at the start line, which is marked at the edge of the circle.
The first player tosses the cowrie shells. The number of cowries landing with the convex side up indicates the number of spaces the player can move.
Players must announce a story or short tale related to the challenge (section number) they're attempting to move to. Creativity is rewarded; a good story might allow a player to move forward even if they didn't roll enough cowries to reach that section.
If a player lands exactly on the same section as another player, they must narrate a challenge to overcome the other player, such as ""I tell a more compelling story about the river crossing,"" and if agreed upon by all players as a better story, the displaced player returns to the start of that challenge section.
If a player fails to tell a story or doesn't roll enough cowries to advance, their turn ends, and they remain in place.
If a player successfully reaches the finish line (a marked section at the opposite end of the circle) after completing all challenges, they win that round.
Optional: To keep score, use pebbles or seeds, one for each completed round win. The first player to a predetermined number of wins (e.g., 3) is declared the ultimate champion",2025,9.709705352783203,6.5,exp_decay

The players sit in a circle on the flat surface.
A player is chosen randomly to start the game, typically the youngest or the one who tells the best story of a royal court adventure.
Gameplay:

Each round, players take turns placing a certain number of pebbles face down in the center of the circle, declaring how many they are placing. They may bluff and declare a different number than they actually place.
After every player has placed their pebbles and declared the number, the pebbles are revealed simultaneously.
Points are awarded based on accuracy of declarations:
If the actual total number of pebbles matches the declared total, all players who declared correctly gain 2 points.
If the guess was off, no points are awarded.
Players retrieve their pebbles, and the next player starts a new round.
Special Rules:

If a player's declaration is incorrect by more than 3 pebbles, they lose 1 point.
If a player runs out of pebbles, they are out of the game.
Players can steal an opponent's pebble if they catch a player bluffing by more than 3 pebbles in a single round.

L57,Olmo,"In this strategic role-playing dice and storytelling game, players embody travelers in ancient Europe, seeking out new lands and spreading tales of their adventures. Success is measured by the tales collected and the lands explored.

Equipment:

5 small stones or pebbles (for dice)
A small cloth or canvas bag to hold the stones
A collection of simple tokens (e.g., leaves, sticks, or small stones)
A map drawn on parchment (or a simple paper) representing ancient Europe
A collection of small trinkets (e.g., beads, buttons, or coins) for ""tales"" or points
A storyteller token (a unique item like a feather or a special stone)
Setup:

Players take turns to roll the stones in the bag. Stones landing face-up (with a smooth side) count as 1, otherwise, they count as 0. Each player rolls three stones and totals the score. The player with the highest total score becomes the starting Traveler and holds the storyteller token.

The map is laid out and landmarks are marked: forests, rivers, mountains, villages, etc. Each landmark has a value representing the difficulty to cross or the richness of tales from that area.

Rules:

On their turn, the Traveler narrates a short story of their journey to a chosen landmark. The more creative and engaging the story, the more points (tales) they can earn. The other players may award points based on their enjoyment of the story (1-3 tales per player).

The Traveler must ""roll"" for their journey to the chosen landmark. They roll the stones, and the total must be equal to or higher than the landmark value to succeed. If successful, they ""collect"" the landmark token and place it in front of them. If not, they remain in their current spot and lose their turn.

After the story and roll, the storyteller token is passed to the next player, who then becomes the new Traveler.
